    <h1>Instructions for participating in MultiCam user study</h1>

First, thanks for your willingness to help me out by participating in
an experiment with video chat.

<P>
To participate, the only thing you need to do is have a Skype
conversation with me. The conversation will last 10-15 minutes.
During the conversation, we'll experiment with two different ways of
controlling the multi-camera setup in my office.  I'll explain how to
do this during the conversation itself, so no preparation is required.
At the end of the conversation I'll ask you a few questions about
which camera-control method worked best for you.  Your answers won't
be linked to your name or any other personally identifiable
information in my records.  No special equipment is needed.  All you
need is a computer with Skype installed. You do <i>not</i> need a camera,
you do <i>not</i> need a microphone or headset, and you can use any kind of
computer (Windows/Mac/Linux).

<P>
If you prefer not to participate, no problem -- stop reading now.

<P>
If you are willing to participate, here is what to do next:

<ol>
  <li>Send email
  to <a href="mailto:jmac@dickinson.edu">jmac@dickinson.edu</a>,
  stating:
    <ol>
      <li>the day and time for our Skype chat that would work best for
  you
      <li>your Skype username (that is, the identifier you use to log
  in to Skype -- see below if you don't have one)
      <li>the best phone number to reach you on in
  case we have trouble getting Skype up and running
    </ol>
   I'm hoping to complete these conversations before approximately
  February 26, so please choose a day before then if possible.  Any
  reasonable time of day or night is fine by me (say, 7am-1030pm US
  Eastern time).  You might want to consult
  my <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/schedule.html">online
  schedule</a> so that you choose a time when I don't already have
  another appointment.

   <li><a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/">Install
   Skype</a> if you don't have it already. The free version is fine.
   Also create a Skype account if you don't have one already (Skype
   will lead you through this process when you run it).  Optionally,
   you can add me to your Skype contact list.  My Skype username is
   "arawatabill".
</ol>

<P>
Thank you so much for your help -- I look forward to Skyping with you!

<P>
Best,

<P>
John

P.S. I don't want to seem secretive, so if you are interested, you're
welcome to check out
the <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/multicam/">MultiCam web
page</a>, which describes the project in a little more detail.  You're
also welcome to download and use the MultiCam software from that page,
but you won't need it for the particular experiment described above.
