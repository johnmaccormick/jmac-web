    <H3>Declaring a major in Math or Computer Science</H3>

There is no formal prerequisite for declaring a major in Math or
Computer Science. However, before you can declare a major, you will
need to have a discussion with your future academic advisor&mdash;a
math or computer science professor assigned to you by the chair of the
department. If, after that discussion, your future advisor agrees that
it is the right time for you to declare your major, you can proceed
with the declaration. The precise steps in this procedure are as
follows.
<ol>
  <li>Send a brief email to Professor David Richeson (richesod@dickinson.edu), the
    chair of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. State
    which major you would like to declare. No justification is needed
    at this stage.
  <li>The department chair will respond to you, informing you which
    professor from the department will be your future academic
    advisor.
  <li>Email your future advisor to arrange a meeting or
  discussion. Your meeting with the future advisor is your chance to
  ask questions about your chosen major. The future advisor will also
  ask you some questions to determine whether it is the right time for
  you declare a major. If the future advisor agrees that you should
    declare, proceed with the final step below.
  <li>Fill out the <i>major declaration form</i> available on
    CLIQ. (Log into
    the <a href="https://gateway.dickinson.edu/">Dickinson
    Gateway</a>, click on the CLIQ icon, then choose Registrar's
    Office Forms on the menu.)

    <!-- <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/200/majordeclare_pdf">major -->
    <!-- declaration form</a> and attach it to a single email message. -->
    <!-- Address the message to these four recipients: -->
    <!-- <ul> -->
    <!--   <li>your current advisor -->
    <!--   <li>your future advisor -->
    <!--   <li>the Math/CS department chair (jmac@dickinson.edu) -->
    <!--   <li>the Registrar's Office (reg@dickinson.edu) -->
    <!-- </ul> -->
    <!-- This message can be very brief. Please state which major you are -->
    <!-- declaring and ask the recipients to "reply all" indicating their -->
    <!-- approval. -->
</ol>
