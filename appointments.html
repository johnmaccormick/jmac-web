    <H3>Meeting with John MacCormick</H3>

    I'm always happy to meet with students.
    <ul>
      <li>To meet with me during scheduled office hours, please follow
	the instructions on the <a href="office-hours.html">office
	  hours page</a>.
      <li>To meet with me outside office hours, it's best to make an
    appointment first.  To make an appointment, first check
    my <A href="schedule.html">schedule</A>, then send me an email
    suggesting two or three suitable times at which we can meet.  I
    will reply indicating which of the options works best.  Thank you
    very much -- I look forward to meeting with you!
    </ul>

    <!-- You can come to my office -->
    <!-- hours without an appointment (please check my <A -->
    <!-- href="schedule.html">schedule</A> for -->
    <!-- current office hours). -->
