    <h2>Final presentation for COMP352: Computer Networks</h2>

The final presentation will summarize a state-of-the-art
research paper on networking.  Each student or team of
students will pick a different paper from the conference
NSDI 2008 (also known as the &quot;Fifth USENIX
Symposium on Networked Systems Design and
Implementation&quot;), read the paper and any necessary
background literature, and present a summary of the
paper.  The list of papers to choose from is available
in the online <A
HREF="http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi08/tech/">NSDI
proceedings</A>.
