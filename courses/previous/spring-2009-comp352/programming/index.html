    <h2>Programming assignments for COMP352: Computer Networks</h2>
    Please see the course <A
    HREF="../schedule.pdf">schedule</A> for due dates.
    Each assignment, or part of the assignment, gives an
    estimated time for completion.  If an assignment is
    taking you significantly longer than the estimated
    time, you should seek help from the instructor or
    your classmates (but of course, do not violate the
    plagiarism and copying rules.)  

<P>

All programming assignment solutions will be submitted
electronically via <A
HREF="https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/WebObjects/Web-CAT.woa">Web-CAT</A>.
No paper copy is required.  If working as a pair, please
submit only one solution, and list both team members in
the author comment at the top of each file submitted.

<P>

Web-CAT will perform some
simple checks on the formatting and style of your code,
awarding you points in the &quot;Style/Coding&quot;
section of the results page.  Points deducted from this
section <B>will</B> be incorporated into your final
grade.  It's true that Web-CAT's style rules are
extremely stringent and occasionally annoying, but you
are nevertheless required to conform to these rules,
even if that requires modifying example code given to
you in an assignment.

<P>

Web-CAT will <B>not</B> run your code to test its
functionality. Also, you are not required to submit any
JUnit tests.  Therefore, even a completely correct
submission will get the following alarming response:

<PRE>
     Results from Running Your Tests (No Tests Submitted!)
     Code Coverage from Your Tests (0%)
     Code Coverage: 0% (percentage of methods exercised by your tests)
     Estimate of Problem Coverage (Unknown!)
     Problem coverage: unknown
     Interpreting Your Correctness/Testing Score (0/0)
</PRE>

Please ignore all of these messages.  The instructor
will examine and grade your code manually, and a random
subset of students will be required to demonstrate their
solutions in class lab time.  The results of this manual
grading will be entered in the
&quot;Design/Readability&quot; section of the Web-CAT
results page.

<P>

The details for each assignment are on a separate page:

<!--P3 consists of the K&R Programming Assignment 4:-->
<!--&quot;Proxy Cache&quot; with some small alterations:-->
<!--<UL>-->
<!--  <LI>Don't do any of the optional or extra credit-->
<!--  exercises.</LI>-->
<!--  <LI><B>For full credit (this is not just for extra-->
<!--    credit) you must implement caching in your proxy.</B>-->
<!--  However, keep the cache as simple as possible: you-->
<!--  should store the cached objects in a suitable-->
<!--  in-memory data structure, and don't bother to-->
<!--  implement any kind of eviction from the cache.  (Note:-->
<!--  this is different from the third optional exercise in-->
<!--  the K&R assignment, which is a little more difficult-->
<!--  because it requires you to store cached objects on-->
<!--  disk rather than in memory.)</LI>-->
<!--  <LI>Estimated time: 3 hours.</LI>-->
<!--</UL>-->
