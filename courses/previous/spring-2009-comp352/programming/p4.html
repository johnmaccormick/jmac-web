    <h2>Programming assignment P4</h2>

In this assignment, you will extend the TIME protocol
from the previous assignment, adding the capability to
set alarms.  

<h4>The  ALARM protocol</h4>

You are provided with two java files, <A
HREF="AlarmServer.java"><TT>AlarmServer.java</TT></A>
and <A
HREF="AlarmClient.java"><TT>AlarmClient.java</TT></A>,
that implement a good deal of the alarm functionality.
These two files implement a simple protocol known as the
ALARM protocol.  The ALARM protocol has a single message
type, called BEEPNOW. An AlarmServer does nothing but
listen on a particular port, waiting for a BEEPNOW
request.  When it receives a BEEPNOW request from any
AlarmClient, it prints out a message saying "BEEP BEEP
BEEP BEEP (yes, this is your wake up call)".  It is
particularly important to note that it is the
<I>client</I> that triggers the alarm at the appropriate
time, by sending a BEEPNOW request, whereas the
<I>server</I> merely beeps when it is told to do so.

<P>You should not make any changes to
<TT>AlarmServer.java</TT> and <TT>AlarmClient.java</TT>,
but you will need to read through them and understand
how they work.  Pay particular attention to the way in
which the server determines the port it will be
listening on.

<P>You can practise running the AlarmServer and AlarmClient from the command line, which will help you to understand how they work.

<h4>The extended TIME protocol</h4>

<P>While the AlarmServer and AlarmClient <I>can</I> be
run from the command line as stand-alone programs, that
is not their main purpose.  Instead, you will be writing
your own code (<TT>TimeServerP4.java</TT> and
<TT>TimeClientP4.java</TT>) to create and use
AlarmServer and AlarmClient objects in order to extend
the TIME protocol.  

<P>Previously, the TIME protocol possessed only the
single message type GETTIME.  In this assignment, you
will be adding the new message type SETALARM.  When a
TimeClient sends a SETALARM request to a TimeServer, it
specifies an "alarm time" in the format HH:MM:SS (using
the 24-hour clock). The TimeServer immediately responds
with a simple response indicating that the request was
processed successfully.  Later, when the TimeServer's
own time reaches the requested alarm time, the
TimeClient must be notified, resulting in the TimeClient
printing out the string "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP (yes, this
is your wake up call)".  The TimeServer must be capable
of having multiple alarms set to go off in the future,
possibly from different clients.

<h4>Interactive TimeClient</h4>

<P>You will also be improving the usability of the
TimeClient by making it interactive.  Instead of issuing
a single request, getting a response, and then exiting,
the TimeClient will sit in a loop, accepting requests
until the user exits.  Specifically, the TimeClient
should perform a GETTIME when the user enters "g", a
SETALARM when the user enters "a HH:MM:SS", and should
exit when the user enters "q".

<h4>Example outputs</h4>

<P> Following is an example of the outputs when the
server is running on the machine
blackbird.dickinson.edu, and the client is run on the
machine albatross.dickinson.edu.

<P>First, we start the server on blackbird:
<PRE>
  blackbird:/tmp jmac$ java TimeServerP4 56765
</PRE>

<P>Then, we run the client on albatross, and start entering commands:
<PRE>
  albatross:/tmp jmac$ java TimeClientP4 blackbird 56765
  Enter 'g' to get the time from the timeserver,
  or 'a HH:MM:SS' to set an alarm
  > g
  TimeServer says time is 17:33:04
  > g
  TimeServer says time is 17:33:08
  > a 17:33:45
  Received successful response from the TimeServer.
  Alarm has been set for 17:33:45
  > g
  TimeServer says time is 17:33:28
  > g
  TimeServer says time is 17:33:34
  >
  
  BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP (yes, this is your wake up call)
  
  g
  TimeServer says time is 17:33:49
  > q
  bye
  albatross:/tmp jmac$
</PRE>

<h4>Submitting your solution</h4>


<P>Your solution should contain exactly 2 files, called
<TT>TimeServerP4.java</TT> and
<TT>TimeClientP4.java</TT>.  If you define any other
classes, add them to one of these files as we did with
the <TT>MyHttpRequest</TT> class in assignment
P2. Submit your code to Web-CAT by first making a zip
file of these two Java files.  (Do not submit
<TT>AlarmServer.java</TT> and <TT>AlarmClient.java</TT>;
remember, you are not permitted to edit these files.)

<h4>Recommended procedure and hints</h4>

<P>Your first step should be to copy your code from
assignment P3 into new files called
<TT>TimeServerP4.java</TT> and
<TT>TimeClientP4.java</TT>.  Search and replace "P3"
with "P4" to reflect the new class names.  If you were
unable to complete assignment P3, or are unhappy with
using your own solution, you may request a solution from
the instructor.

<P>Your next step should be to carefully plan how you
will use the AlarmServer and AlarmClient classes.
Specifically: will TimeServerP4 use AlarmServer objects,
AlarmClient objects, or both?  Under what circumstances
will these objects be created?  Now answer the same
questions for TimeClientP4.  

<P>Next, work through the "Example outputs" above,
writing out the exact messages that must be sent to and
from all of your TimeServerP4, TimeClientP4,
AlarmServer, and AlarmClient objects in order for the
example to work correctly.

<P>Finally, you are ready to start writing code.  Here
are a couple of snippets that should help.  Firstly,
some example code for reading the user's input in a
loop:

<PRE>
                 BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
				new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		boolean quit = false;
		while (!quit) {
			System.out.print("> ");
			System.out.flush();
			String input = in.readLine();
			if (input.startsWith("g")) {
			    ...
			} else if (input.startsWith("a")) {
			    ...
			} else if (input.startsWith("q")) {
				quit = true;
				System.out.println("bye");
			}
		}
</PRE>
Second, a method for computing the number of
milliseconds between the current time, and another time
specified as a string:
<PRE>
	/**
	 * Return the offset between the timeVal parameter given
	 * as a string in 24-hour format HH:MM:SS, and the
	 * current system time, computed in milliseconds. If
	 * timeVal is earlier than the current system time, we
	 * assume it refers to the next day, so the value
	 * returned is nonnegative.
	 * 
	 * @param timeVal
	 *            in 24-hour format HH:MM:SS
	 * @return milliseconds between current system time and
	 *         timeVal
	 */
	public long computeTimeOffset(String timeVal) {
		StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(
				timeVal, ":");
		int hours = Integer.parseInt(tokens.nextToken());
		int minutes = Integer.parseInt(tokens.nextToken());
		int seconds = Integer.parseInt(tokens.nextToken());
		Calendar now = Calendar.getInstance();
		long hourDiff = ((long) (hours - now
				.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY))) * 3600 * 1000;
		long minuteDiff = ((long) (minutes - now
				.get(Calendar.MINUTE))) * 60 * 1000;
		long secondDiff = ((long) (seconds - now
				.get(Calendar.SECOND))) * 1000;
		long totalDiff = hourDiff + minuteDiff + secondDiff;
		// add a day's worth of milliseconds if the offset
		// is negative
		if (totalDiff < 0) {
			totalDiff += 24 * 3600 * 1000;
		}
		return totalDiff;
	}
</PRE>

<h4>Extra credit</h4>

For a small amount of extra credit on this assignment
(at most 5% of the total score), you can attempt the
following task: reverse engineer the instructor's
implementation of the TIME protocol, so that your client
and server are interoperable with the instructor's
client and server.  In other words, it should be
possible to run your own client with the instructor's
server, and vice versa.

<P>The instructor's implementation, available as <A
HREF="instructorTIME.zip">instructorTIME.zip</A>, is
provided as Java byte code only, so you will not be able
to tackle this problem by inspecting the code.  Instead,
use Wireshark to determine the exact format of the
messages used in the instructor's TIME protocol, then
alter your own code to conform to this format.
