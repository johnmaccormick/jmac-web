    <h2>Programming assignments for COMP352: Computer Networks</h2>
    Please see the course <A
    HREF="../schedule.pdf">schedule</A> for due dates.
    Each assignment, or part of the assignment, gives an
    estimated time for completion.  If an assignment is
    taking you significantly longer than the estimated
    time, you should seek help from the instructor or
    your classmates (but of course, do not violate the
    plagiarism and copying rules.)  

<P>

All programming assignment solutions will be submitted
electronically via <A
HREF="https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/WebObjects/Web-CAT.woa">Web-CAT</A>.
No paper copy is required. Web-CAT will perform some
simple checks on the formatting and style of your code,
awarding you points in the &quot;Style/Coding&quot;
section of the results page.  Points deducted from this
section <B>will</B> be incorporated into your final
grade.  It's true that Web-CAT's style rules are
extremely stringent and occasionally annoying, but you
are nevertheless required to conform to these rules,
even if that requires modifying example code given to
you in an assignment.

<P>

Web-CAT will <B>not</B> run your code to test its
functionality. Also, you are not required to submit any
JUnit tests.  Therefore, even a completely correct
submission will get the following alarming response:

<PRE>
     Results from Running Your Tests (No Tests Submitted!)
     Code Coverage from Your Tests (0%)
     Code Coverage: 0% (percentage of methods exercised by your tests)
     Estimate of Problem Coverage (Unknown!)
     Problem coverage: unknown
     Interpreting Your Correctness/Testing Score (0/0)
</PRE>

Please ignore all of these messages.  The instructor
will examine and grade your code manually, and a random
subset of students will be required to demonstrate their
solutions in class lab time.  The results of this manual
grading will be entered in the
&quot;Design/Readability&quot; section of the Web-CAT
results page.

    <h3>Programming assignment P1</h3>

P1 consists of two K&R Programming assignments:
&quot;Assignment 2a: A Simplified Mail User Agent:
Without GUI&quot;, and &quot;Assignment 3: UDP
Pinger&quot;.  A few hints and additional details
follow.
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Simplified Mail User Agent</B>
	<UL>
	  <LI>The standard Dickinson mail server
	  (<TT>exmail.dickinson.edu</TT>) does not
	  permit unauthenticated sending of messages.
	  For this lab, you should use Dickinson's
	  legacy mail server, which is
	  <TT>mail.dickinson.edu</TT>.</LI>

	  <LI>Estimated completion time: one hour</LI>
	</UL>
      </LI>
      
      <LI><B>UDP Pinger</B>
	<UL>
	  <LI>Although the assignment does not
	  explicitly say so, your client program should
	  print out the contents and round-trip time for
	  each packet that yields a response, and a
	  suitable error message for packets that do not
	  yield a response.  So your output should look
	  something like this:
	  <PRE>
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 0 Fri Jan 16 12:26:53 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 168 milliseconds
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 1 Fri Jan 16 12:26:54 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 17 milliseconds
     
     receive timed out -- packet assumed lost
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 3 Fri Jan 16 12:26:59 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 58 milliseconds
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 4 Fri Jan 16 12:27:00 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 88 milliseconds
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 5 Fri Jan 16 12:27:01 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 132 milliseconds
     
     receive timed out -- packet assumed lost
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 7 Fri Jan 16 12:27:06 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 87 milliseconds
     
     ...</PRE>
	  </LI>

	  <LI>A useful snippet for producing a string with the current date and time is:
	    <PRE>
	      Date now = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
	      String nowString = now.toString();</PRE>
</LI>
      

      <LI>As stated in the assignment, you will need
      to investigate the API of <TT>DatagramSocket</TT>
      in order to implement the receive timeout.  Hint:
      you will need to surround the <TT>receive</TT>
      call with an appropriate try/catch block.</LI>

      <LI>Estimated completion time: two hours</LI>
	</UL>
      </LI>
    </UL>

<h3>Programming assignment P2</h3>

P2 consists of the K&R Programming Assignment 1:
&quot;Building a Multi-Threaded Web Server&quot;.  
<UL>
  <LI>To test your program, you'll need to place the
  source HTML of a simple webpage in the same directory
  as the program.  If you want, you can use this <A
  HREF="jmac-homepage.zip">zip file of my home page</A>
  for this purpose.</LI>
  <LI>Estimated time: 2 hours.</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Programming assignment P3</h3>

P3 consists of the K&R Programming Assignment 4:
&quot;Proxy Cache&quot; with some small alterations:
<UL>
  <LI>Don't do any of the optional or extra credit
  exercises.</LI>
  <LI><B>For full credit (this is not just for extra
    credit) you must implement caching in your proxy.</B>
  However, keep the cache as simple as possible: you
  should store the cached objects in a suitable
  in-memory data structure, and don't bother to
  implement any kind of eviction from the cache.  (Note:
  this is different from the third optional exercise in
  the K&R assignment, which is a little more difficult
  because it requires you to store cached objects on
  disk rather than in memory.)</LI>
  <LI>Estimated time: 3 hours.</LI>
</UL>
