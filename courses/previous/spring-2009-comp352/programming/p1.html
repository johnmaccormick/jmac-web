    <h2>Programming assignment P1</h2>

P1 consists of two K&R Programming assignments:
&quot;Assignment 2a: A Simplified Mail User Agent:
Without GUI&quot;, and &quot;Assignment 3: UDP
Pinger&quot;.  A few hints and additional details
follow.
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Simplified Mail User Agent</B>
	<UL>
	  <LI>The standard Dickinson mail server
	  (<TT>exmail.dickinson.edu</TT>) does not
	  permit unauthenticated sending of messages.
	  For this lab, you should use Dickinson's
	  legacy mail server, which is
	  <TT>mail.dickinson.edu</TT>.</LI>

	  <LI>Estimated completion time: one hour</LI>
	</UL>
      </LI>
      
      <LI><B>UDP Pinger</B>
	<UL>
	  <LI>Although the assignment does not
	  explicitly say so, your client program should
	  print out the contents and round-trip time for
	  each packet that yields a response, and a
	  suitable error message for packets that do not
	  yield a response.  So your output should look
	  something like this:
	  <PRE>
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 0 Fri Jan 16 12:26:53 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 168 milliseconds
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 1 Fri Jan 16 12:26:54 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 17 milliseconds
     
     receive timed out -- packet assumed lost
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 3 Fri Jan 16 12:26:59 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 58 milliseconds
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 4 Fri Jan 16 12:27:00 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 88 milliseconds
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 5 Fri Jan 16 12:27:01 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 132 milliseconds
     
     receive timed out -- packet assumed lost
     
     Received from 127.0.0.1: PING 7 Fri Jan 16 12:27:06 EST 2009
     Round-trip time was 87 milliseconds
     
     ...</PRE>
	  </LI>

	  <LI>A useful snippet for producing a string with the current date and time is:
	    <PRE>
	      Date now = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
	      String nowString = now.toString();</PRE>
</LI>
      

      <LI>As stated in the assignment, you will need
      to investigate the API of <TT>DatagramSocket</TT>
      in order to implement the receive timeout.  Hint:
      you will need to surround the <TT>receive</TT>
      call with an appropriate try/catch block.</LI>

      <LI>Estimated completion time: two hours</LI>
	</UL>
      </LI>
    </UL>
