    <h2>Exams for COMP352: Computer Networks</h2>

Each exam will cover material from a specified set of
lectures, which in turn are based on a specified set of
chapters in the textbook.  Technically, any material
covered in the specified lectures is eligible to be
examined. However, for each exam a list of "important
topics" will be provided.  Most examination questions
will be either (i) closely related to one of the
"important topics"; or (ii) similar to one of the
"self-assessment quiz" questions provided on the <A
HREF="http://wps.aw.com/aw_kurose_network_4/63/16303/4173750.cw/index.html">student
resource</A> section of the textbook website.
Therefore, the best method of preparation is to ensure
you can effortlessly and correctly complete all
self-assessment quiz questions and easily reproduce any
analyses in the important topics.

<P> The exams are open book, meaning you can bring and
use any printed or handwritten materials. However, no
electronic devices of any kind whatsoever may be used.

<P> It is highly advisable to show your working in all
exam answers, as partial credit for incorrect answers
can only be given if your working demonstrates a correct
understanding of the concepts being examined.

<H3>Exam 1</H3>

Exam 1 covers lectures 1-6, and textbook chapters 1 and 2.  The "important topics" are 
<UL>
  <LI>Computing network delays and transmission times,
  including the four types of delay and the effect of
  FDM and TDM.</LI> 
  
  <LI>Computing the effect of caching web proxies on
  delays, as covered in the textbook's section
  2.2.5.</LI> 

  <LI> Computing the time to download a file in a
  client-server architecture and a P2P architecture, as
  covered in lecture 6 (see the provided <A
  HREF="../resources/P2Panalysis.pdf">notes</A>).</LI> 

</UL> 

In addition, you should of course be familiar with all
the self-assessment quiz questions for chapters 1 and 2.

<H3>Exam 2</H3>

Exam 2 covers lectures 7-13, and textbook chapters 3 and 4.  The "important topics" are 
<UL>
  <LI>Qualitative properties of the reliable data
  transfer protocols, described in the text book as RDT
  1.0-3.0.</LI>
  
  <LI>Computing the utilization of a stop-and-wait
  protocol, as described in Section 3.4.2 of the
  textbook.</LI>

  <LI>Estimating RTT and deviation of RTT using
  exponential weighted moving averages.</LI>

  <LI>Understanding the average throughput of TCP due to
  the additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease
  congestion control, as described in "Macroscopic
  Description of TCP Throughput" on page 286 of the
  textbook.</LI>

  <LI>Subnet address calculations (see Lecture 11
  resource on <A
    HREF="../resources/subnet-calculations.htm">subnet
  calculations</A>).</LI>

  <LI>Distance vector calculations (see Lecture 12
  resource on <A
    HREF="../resources/distance-vector.pdf">distance
    vector
  calculations</A>).</LI>

</UL> 

In addition, you should of course be familiar with the
self-assessment quiz questions for chapters 3 and 4; but
note the following exceptions and additional details:
<UL>
  <LI>Chapter 3 multichoice: skip question 9 (SYN
  cookies not examinable)</LI>

  <LI>Chapter 4 multichoice: skip questions 2 (technical
  details of the link state algorithm not examinable,
  but qualitative properties of the algorithm are
  examinable), questions 8 and 9 (details of router
  hardware are not examinable), question 10 (IPsec was
  not covered in class; details are not examinable, but
  you should know what it is)</LI> 


  <LI>Chapter 4 true/false: questions 7 and 8 <I>are</I>
  examinable, but note that the phrase "IP network"
  means the same thing as "subnet" in this context</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Exam 3</H3>

Exam 3 covers lectures 14-23, and textbook chapters 5, 6
and 8.  

<P>The precise sections of the textbook you should be
familiar with are: 

<UL>

  <LI>5.1.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.3.0, 5.3.1, 5.3.2 (skip
  non-slotted ALOHA), 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2,
  5.6.1, 5.6.2</LI>

  <LI>6.1, 6.2.0, 6.3.0, 6.3.1, 6.3.2 (skip RTS and
  CTS), 6.3.3, 6.3.4</LI>

  <LI>8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5.0, 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 8.6.0, 8.6.1,
  8.7.0, 8.8.0, 8.9.1, 8.9.2</LI>

</UL>

<P>The "important topics" are <UL>
  <LI>CRC calculations</LI>
  
  <LI>RSA encryption and decryption</LI>

  <LI>RSA digital signatures</LI>

  <LI>Providing authentication and integrity via MACs</LI>

</UL> 

<P> <A
HREF="../resources/CRC-and-cryptography-examples.pdf">Example
questions</A> for all important topics are provided.
The only questions in the exam that require mathematical
calculation will be very similar to the example
questions provided.

<P>The self-assessment quiz questions for chapters 5,6,
and 8 will help you to prepare for the exam, but because
we skipped many sections in the textbook, many of the
self-assessment quiz questions are not relevant.  The
precise questions relevant to the exam are:

<UL>
  <LI>Chapter 5 multichoice: questions 1-7, 9</LI>
  <LI>Chapter 5 true/false: questions 1-6,8,10</LI>
  <LI>Chapter 6 multichoice: questions 2,4,5</LI>
  <LI>Chapter 6 true/false: questions 1,3-7</LI>
  <LI>Chapter 8 multichoice: questions 1-8,10</LI>
  <LI>Chapter 8 true/false: questions 1-3,8-10</LI>
</UL>
