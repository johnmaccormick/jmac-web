    <h2>Labs for COMP352: Computer Networks</h2>

    <UL>
      <LI>Please see the course <A
    HREF="../schedule.pdf">schedule</A> for due
    dates.</LI>
      <LI>Instructions for running Wireshark: 
	<UL>
	  <LI>On the Macs in Room 231 (doesn't work on
	  other Macs in Tome). 1. Launch the X11
	  application from the applications
	  folder. 2. If an X11 terminal window did not
	  open automatically, open one by choosing
	  &quot;Terminal&quot; in the X11
	  &quot;Applications&quot; menu. (Note: this
	  terminal window is different from the regular
	  terminal window you can open from the
	  machine's application folder. Do not use a
	  regular terminal window.)  3. enter the
	  command &quot;/sw/bin/wireshark&quot;</LI>

	  <LI>You can install and run Wireshark on your
	  own computer by following the instructions at
	  <A
	  HREF="http://www.wireshark.org/">www.wireshark.org</A></LI>
	</UL> </LI> 

<LI>Computer networks are extremely complex and rarely
behave exactly as you expect; Wireshark is an evolving
piece of software. As a result, many of these labs do
not function precisely as the authors intended.  Do not
be concerned if you encounter unexpected results.  Make
an honest attempt at every question, and record the
results that you obtain, whether or not they agree with
expectations.  In addition, the authors provide packet
traces that can be used instead of collecting your own
trace.  Don't hesitate to use these if necessary.</LI>

<LI><B>Lab L1</B>: Consists of two K&R Wireshark labs:
&quot;getting started&quot;, and &quot;HTTP&quot;</LI>

<LI><B>Lab L2</B>: Consists of the K&R Wireshark lab
&quot;DNS&quot;</LI>

<LI><B>Lab L3</B>: Consists of the K&R Wireshark lab
&quot;TCP&quot;</LI>

<LI><B>Lab L4</B>: Consists of the K&R Wireshark lab
  &quot;Ethernet and ARP&quot;.  A <A HREF="ethernet-hints.pdf">hint sheet</A> is provided.</LI>

<LI><B>Lab L5</B>: Consists of any K&R Wireshark lab
that has not yet been completed (i.e. one of IP, ICMP,
DHCP, 802.11, SSL, UDP).  Choose the one that looks most
interesting to you. The rubric for grading this lab will
be extremely lenient: a perfect grade will be awarded
for an honest attempt at all questions.  If you
encounter difficulties, give a brief description of the
difficulties, and move on to the next question.</LI>
