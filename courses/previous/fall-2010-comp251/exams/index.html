      questions, and the example question.  Note that
      homework solutions up to and including class 11 are provided
      on Moodle.

<P>It is highly
      advisable to

      your working demonstrates a correct understanding
      of the concepts being examined.  This exam is open
      book, meaning you can bring and use any printed or
      handwritten materials. However, no electronic

      will be similar to a homework question, or the questions on
      the caching handout from class 21.  Therefore, the best method
      of
      preparation is to ensure you can effortlessly and
      correctly complete all these questions.  Note that

     correctly complete all homework questions,
     previous exam questions, and worksheets.  Note
