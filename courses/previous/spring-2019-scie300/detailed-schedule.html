Excursion to Cambridge.

<P>Required preparation: pick one Nobel prize awarded to a Cambridge
      University academic
      (e.g. from <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/research-at-cambridge/nobel-prize">this
      list</a>). Do some brief online research to find out a few
      details about the career of the prizewinner and the work that
      earned the prize. Be ready to tell the rest of the group about
      it (speak for 1-2 minutes).

<P>Schedule:      

<P>Meet at Norwich train station by 8:25 AM. Depart on 8:40 AM train, arrive Cambridge 9:59 AM. Bring your 16-25 railcard.

<P>10:30 AM: Meet in front of the Guildhall, Market Square for
1.5-hour walking tour of Cambridge focusing on history and culture of the University and also drawing on scientific themes, including
Trinity College tour.

<P>The remainder of the day is flexible. You are required to
visit a museum or similar venue of cultural/academic interest and take a few notes so that you can contribute to a subsequent class discussion (be prepared to speak for about three minutes) OR if you are feeling a little adventurous you may choose to go punting on the River Cam (not the chauffeur punting but the kind where you yourself provide the propulsion). Suggested museums for sciences program students:
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/">Polar Museum</a>
      at the Scott Polar Research Institute
    <li><a href="http://maa.cam.ac.uk/">Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology</a>
    <li><a href="http://www.sedgwickmuseum.org/">Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences</a>
      (fossils, dinosaurs, etc.)
      <li><a href="http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/">Museum of Zoology</a>
      <li><a href="http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/">Fitzwilliam Museum</a> (fine art museum)
      <li>...or it may be easier to go to the overview of all <a href="https://www.museums.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University museums</a>.
      <li>...and for
	punting, <a href="https://www.scudamores.com">Scudamore's</a>
	is the best option, probably easiest from
	their <a href="https://www.scudamores.com/punting-mill-lane">Mill
	Lane Punting Station</a>. If you hire a punt, keep the receipt
	and Dickinson will reimburse half the cost (for self-hire, not
	chauffeur).
  </ul>
All of the museums above are free, open until 4 PM or 4:30 PM on
Saturdays, and located within easy walking distance of the city
center. If you prefer to visit a different site, please check with the
instructor in advance to make sure it is suitable.

<P>Optional afternoon event: meet at 3pm,
  at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EL46YiqHuDn">The Anchor</a> pub on
  Silver Street, where the Dickinson program will be happy to provide
  you with a beverage.

choosing (e.g. the 4:35PM train arrives back in Norwich 6:13pm).
