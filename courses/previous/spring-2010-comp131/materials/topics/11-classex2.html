<H3>Practice Exercises</H3>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Implement a <code>Song</code> class that represents songs as follows:
<OL type='a'>
<li>Use BlueJ to create a new project called <i>MySong</i> that is stored in your <i>CS131</i> directory.
<li>Create a new class named <code>Song</code> in your <i>MySong</i> project.
<li>Define fields so that each song can keep track of the band name, the title of the song, the length of the song in minutes as a decimal (e.g. 3.45 minutes), and a rating for the song. The rating can be an integer number with higher numbers indicating a better song.
<li>Define a constructor for the <code>Song</code> class that has parameters which allow the band name, title and the length of the song to be initialized.  New songs should have a rating of 0.
<li>Define accesor methods for each of the fields in the <code>Song</code> class. 
<li>Define a method <code>setRating</code> that takes one parameter indicating a new rating for the song.  This method should change the song's rating.

<H3>Homework Assignment 4a</H3>
<ol>
<li>Implement a <code>Movie</code> class that represents movies as follows:
<OL type='a'>
<li>Use BlueJ to create a new project called <i>MyMovie</i> that is stored in your <i>CS131</i> directory.
<li>Create a new class named <code>Movie</code> in your <i>MyMovie</i> project.
<li>Define fields so that each movie can keep track of the title of the movie, the length of the movie in hours as a decimal (e.g. 2.15 hours), the MPAA rating of the movie (e.g. G, PG, R etc) and a star rating. The star rating will indicate how much you liked the movie.  This star rating can be an integer number with higher numbers indicating more stars and a better movie (i.e. you liked a 5 star movie better than a 2 star movie).
<li>Define a constructor for the <code>Movie</code> class that has parameters that allow the movie title, the length of the movie and the movies' MPAA rating  to be initialized.  New movies should have a star rating of 0.
<li>Define accessor methods for each of the fields in the <code>Movie</code> class. 
<li>Define a method <code>setStarRating</code> that takes one parameter indicating a new star rating for the movie.  This method should change the movie's star rating.
</ol>
Turn in a printout of your <code>Movie</code> class definition as your solution
for this question.
