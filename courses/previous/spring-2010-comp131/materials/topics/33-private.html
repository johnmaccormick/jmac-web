<h2><code>public</code> vs. <code>private</code><hr>
</h2></center>

<h3>Reading Assignments</h3>
<p>
Section 5.11 of Barnes &amp; Kolling
</p><hr>

<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p>
<a href="../examples/FactorOutExample.zip"><i>FactorOutExample</i><br>
<a href="../examples/StudentDatabase-v1.zip"><i>StudentDatabase-v1</i></a> (<code>ArrayList</code> based)<br>
<a href="../examples/LibraryDB.zip"><i>LibraryDB</i></a>
</p><hr>
<h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
<p>
Use the <i>StudentDatabase-v1</i>
project to complete each of the following exercises:
<ol>
<li> Should any of the methods that you added to the <code>Student</code>
  class in the practice exercises from our last class be declared as 
  <code>private</code>?  Justify your answer.

<li> Add a method to the <code>RegistrarsOffice</code> class to count and
    display the number of students who are eligible to graduate with each
    level of latin honors.  The
    minimum GPA required to graduate summa cum laude is 3.8, to graduate
    magna cum laude is 3.6, and to graduate cum laude is 3.4.
    Be sure to include a javadoc comment for your method.

</ol>

<h3>Homework Assignment 10b</h3>
<p>
Complete the following exercises using
the <i>LibraryDB</i> project that you started in the last homework.
<OL>
<li> Should any of the method(s) that you added to the <code>Library</code>
  class in the homework exercises from our last class be declared as 
  <code>private</code>?  Justify your answer.  If your answer is yes,
  change the signature of those method(s) so that they are <code>private</code>
  and then make sure that your test cases still pass.
<li> Complete the definitions of the <code>checkOutBook</code> and 
   <code>returnBook</code> methods of the <code>Library</code> class.
   <p>
   Hint: make use of a method call for each.
                                                                                
<li> Write test cases for the <code>checkOutBook</code> and
 <code>returnBook</code> methods that properly test those methods.

<li> Modify the constructor of the <code>Book</code> class so that the
 subject of the new book is set to Fly Fishing if the parameter for the subject
 is not one of Math, Computer Science, History or Fly Fishing (because all
 books are about Fly Fishing if you really want them to be).
 Update the javadoc for the constructor, and add test cases as appropriate.

</ol>
Save this project.  You will be adding to it in the next two assignments
and then submitting it via Web-CAT.
