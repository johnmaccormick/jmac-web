<h2>Final project for COMP251</h2>


<P>The bulk of the last week of classes will be spent on an ungraded
  final project. In these classes, we will also spend a little time
  doing revision for the final exam, and mentioning one or two
  interesting (but non-examinable) topics in computer architecture.
  The primary recommended project is Project 1 from Nisan and
  Schocken's <i>Elements of Computing Systems</i>.  All the necessary
  resources are available on this
  book's <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html">Study Plan</a>
  page.  You will need to download the necessary software from the
  "Software" link on that page. Then, go to the "Project 1" link and
  follow the instructions there.

<P>Before you start, do the following required reading. From the
book <i>The Elements of Computing Systems</i>, by Noam Nisan and
Shimon Schocken, read the publicly-available online versions
of <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/book/chapter%2001.pdf">Chapter
1</a>
and <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/book/appendix_a.pdf">Appendix
A</a> (Sections 1-6 only). Also check out
the <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html">Study Plan</a> page
for more resources, such as lecture slides.


<P>Project 1 concerns designing logic gates. If you're already
familiar with this topic, or perhaps you just prefer to do something
different, you might consider tackling Project 6 instead. This is a
very interesting and educational project in which you write an
assembler program for a particular instruction set.  Before starting
the project, you will need to read Chapter 6 of the book (and
possibly refer back to some earlier parts of the book too).  This
project is a little more challenging than Project 1.

<P>If you enjoy these projects, why not try some of the others? They
are all extremely worthwhile and will increase the depth of your
knowledge and experience as a computer scientist.  Almost all the
resources you need are provided online. In addition, you can purchase
a copy of the book, or use the copy in the Tome library.
