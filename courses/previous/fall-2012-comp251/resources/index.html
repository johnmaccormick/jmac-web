<h2>Detailed schedule and resources for COMP251</h2>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: Monday, August 27</FONT></h4>

Brief introduction to syllabus.

<P>Minilab: 
<UL>

<LI>Read, then run each of the methods in <A
HREF="CodeParadoxes.java">CodeParadoxes.java</A>.  Make sure you
clearly understand the output you would expect from an "ideal"
computer (whatever that means!).  Then make a note of the different
output that was actually produced.  </LI>

<LI>Choose one of the code paradoxes you just observed. (I recommend
choosing the infinite loop, unless you already know the answer.)  By
editing, debugging, and investigating the code, see if you can come
up with an explanation resolving the paradox.  If you cannot fully
explain the paradox, at least try to determine some of the
circumstances which trigger it. </LI>

</UL>

<P>We may also have time to discuss the paradox in <A
HREF="SheepTracker.java">SheepTracker.java</A>.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Thursday, August 30</FONT></h4>

These links will help us understand the von Neumann architecture
(and give us a blast from the past for those who are nostalgic about
COMP131):
    <UL>
      <LI><a href="http://dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/instructions.html">The Knob &amp; Switch Computer Assembly Language</a></LI>
<!--      <LI><a href = "javascript:openIt('http://dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/datapath.html');">The Basic Knob &amp; Switch Computer</a></LI>-->

    </UL>

<P>Challenge 1: implement MM[9] = MM[8] - MM[7] on the knob and
switch computer above.

<P>Challenge 2: find out as much as you can about the hardware of
the computer you're working on (CPU specs, memory specs, disk drive,
and anything else you can think of).

<P>If there's time, we'll do a quick mini-lab that will get you
started on Homework exercise 1.5, using <A HREF="SmallProgram.java">SmallProgram.java</A>  as a starting point.  As a reminder, here are some basic terminal commands useful for compiling a Java program:
<ul>
  <li><tt>pwd</tt>: print working directory i.e. print the name of the directory you are currently in
  <li><tt>cd somewhere</tt>: change directory to the folder "somewhere" e.g. <tt>cd Desktop</tt> if you have saved your Java file on the desktop.
<li><tt>ls</tt>: list contents of current directory
<li><tt>ls -l</tt>: detailed listing of current directory
<li><tt>ls -l *.java</tt>: list details of all Java files in the current directory
<li><tt>ls -l SmallProgram.*</tt>: list details of all files whose names start with "SmallProgram"
<li><tt>javac SmallProgram.java</tt>: compile the Java file SmallProgram.java
<li><tt>java SmallProgram</tt>: run the main method in SmallProgram
<li>Don't forget, you can use the up-arrow key to go back to previous commands. And you can use the tab key to complete most commands.
    </ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 3: Monday, September 3</FONT></h4>

Interesting background on why binary numbers are used in computers:
the designers of one of the earliest computers give their reasoning in
section 5.2 of <i>Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an
Electronic Computing Instrument</i>, by Burks, Goldstine, and von
Neumann (1947), available on Moodle.

<P>Announcement: solutions to homework assignment 1 are now available
on Moodle.

<P>The textbook's table 2.2 (page 63 in 2nd edition, page 71 in 3nd
edition) is extremely important, but difficult to
understand. Here's <A HREF="carry-in-and-out.pdf">my explanation</A>
of the table.

<P>Minilab using <A
HREF="SignedIntExperiments.java">SignedIntExperiments.java</A>:
  <OL>
    <LI>Don't try to understand the code.  Skip to the
<TT>main</TT> method, and make sure you understand its output.</LI>

<LI>Do
the challenge exercise in the comments at the end of the code.

<LI>Now go back and try to understand the code, especially
<TT>makeBitString()</TT>.

  </OL>

<P>As discussed in the lecture, Java gives no warnings about integer
overflows. <A HREF="http://www.drdobbs.com/java/210500001">This
article</A> discusses one way of adding such warnings to Java -- it
is rather advanced, and requires you to learn something about Java
byte code, but if you're interested in this kind of thing, is well
worth it.



<P>Minilab code:
<A HREF="FloatingPointExperiments.java">FloatingPointExperiments.java</A>

<P>Some further experiments to try at home:
  <OL>
    <LI>Compute (0.1+0.2)+0.3 and 0.1+(0.2+0.3) in Java. Are they the same? Explain your result.</LI>

<LI>Write some Java code that will initialize a double to 1.0,
then repeatedly multiply its value by 10, printing out the result
each time.  What happens?  Why?  Can you explain the exact time at
which things start to go wrong?

<h5>Java bytecode minilab</h5>

<P>Here is a simple Java program that we can compile, then disassemble,
to understand something about Java bytecode: <A
HREF="Mult.java">Mult.java</A>.

<P>Here are the steps to follow for this minilab:
<ul>
  <li><i>Compile</i> the Java source code: <TT>javac Mult.java</TT>.
  As you know, this produces a Java class file called <TT>Mult.class</TT>.

  <li><i>Disassemble</i> the Java class file: <TT>javap -c Mult</TT>.  This
  will show on the screen the complete listing of JVM instructions
  (also known as Java bytecode) in the class file.  For convenience,
  save the bytecode in a text file called <tt>bytecode.txt</tt> so you
  can examine it later. Do this by redirecting the output using the
  "&gt;" character: <blockquote><TT>javap -c Mult &gt; bytecode.txt</TT></blockquote>

  <li><i>View</i> the raw contents of the Java class file.  To do this, we
  will use a simple program called "od" which stands for "octal dump."
  The precise command line to use is: <tt>od -Ax -t x1
  Mult.class</tt>.  This will show on the screen a listing of the
  binary content of the class file.  The left-hand column shows the
  hexadecimal addresses within the file, and in each row we see 16
  bytes of the file's contents displayed in hexadecimal.  Again, let's
  use redirection to save the output to a text file so we can easily
  examine it later: <blockquote>
      <tt>od -Ax -t x1 Mult.class &gt; rawBytes.txt</tt>
      </blockquote>

  <li>Now open the two text files <tt>bytecode.txt</tt>
  and <tt>rawBytes.txt</tt> in any text editor, such as
  TextEdit. Notice the sequence of instructions 4-6
  in <tt>bytecode.txt</tt> is iload_1, iload_2, imul.  As you can see
  from
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings">Java
  bytecode listings on Wikipedia</a>, the opcode for iload_1 is 1b,
  the opcode for iload_2 is 1c, and the opcode for imul is 68. So,
  verify that the sequence "1b 1c 68" occurs somewhere in the
  file <tt>rawBytes.txt</tt>.  What other Java bytecode instructions
  can you find?

  <li>If you are interested, read a little bit
  about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java
  bytecode</a> on Wikipedia.  One interesting point is that the
  instruction set employs a stack, and so there are many instructions
  that do not need any explicit operands.  For example, the imul
  instruction doesn't need any operands. It simply pops the two top
  elements off the stack, multiplies them together, and pushes the
  result back onto the stack.

</ul>

<P>Brief discussion of whether or not the course achieved its goals
and what were the high-level lessons of the course: a
 <a href="architecture-goals.pptx">presentation</a> on this topic is
available.

<P>Remainder of time: individual work
on <a href="final-project.html">final project</a> instead.  Also,
revision for final exam: bring any questions to class.

<!-- Required reading: From the book <i>The Elements of Computing -->
<!-- Systems</i>, by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, read the -->
<!-- publicly-available online versions -->
<!-- of <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/book/chapter%2001.pdf">Chapter -->
<!-- 1</a> -->
<!-- and <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/book/appendix_a.pdf">Appendix -->
<!-- A</a> (Sections 1-6 only). -->

<!-- <P>Check out the <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html">Study -->
<!-- Plan</a> page for more resources, such as lecture slides. -->

<!-- <P><B>Final Project:</B> The bulk of the last three classes will -->
<!--   be spent on an ungraded final project. In these classes, we will -->
<!--   also spend a little time doing revision for the final exam, and -->
<!--   mentioning one or two interesting (but non-examinable) topics in -->
<!--   computer architecture.  The primary recommended project is Project -->
<!--   1 from Nisan and Schocken's <i>Elements of Computing Systems</i>. -->
<!--   All the necessary resources are available on this book's <a -->
<!--   href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html">Study Plan</a> page. -->
<!--   You will need to download the necessary software from the -->
<!--   "Software" link on that page. Then, go to the "Project 1" link and -->
<!--   follow the instructions there. -->

<!-- <P>Project 1 concerns designing logic gates. If you're already -->
<!-- familiar with this topic, or perhaps you just prefer to do something -->
<!-- different, you might consider tackling Project 6 instead. This is a -->
<!-- very interesting and educational project in which you write an -->
<!-- assembler program for a particular instruction set.  Before starting -->
<!-- the project, you will need to read Chapter 6 of the book (and -->
<!-- possibly refer back to some earlier parts of the book too).  This -->
<!-- project is a little more challenging than Project 1. -->

<!-- <P>If you enjoy these projects, why not try some of the others? They -->
<!-- are all extremely worthwhile and will increase the depth of your -->
<!-- knowledge and experience as a computer scientist.  Almost all the -->
<!-- resources you need are provided online. In addition, you can -->
<!-- purchase a copy of the book, or use the copy that will soon arrive -->
<!-- in the Tome library. -->
