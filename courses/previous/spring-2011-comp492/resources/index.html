Stephen's discussion

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 11: April 12</FONT></h4>

In preparation for next week's visit to MapQuest, spend some time
familiarizing yourself with MapQuest's technology.  In particular,
please work through the following exercises.  Make written notes as
you work, especially noting questions that you may want to ask during
the visit next week.
<ol>
  <li>Plan our driving route from Carlisle to MapQuest (their address
  is 300 Granite Run Dr, Lancaster, PA 17601) using all three of the
  major online mapping services (Google, Bing, MapQuest).  In each
  case, prepare two alternative routes: one that uses the turnpike
  (I76) and one that does not.  Make a note of any significant
  differences between the three services.
  <li>Read a little bit about the techniques for writing software that
  uses MapQuest technology,
  at <a href="http://developer.mapquest.com/">developer.mapquest.com</a>.
  <li>In particular, read about the very interesting open-source-like
  approach MapQuest is using for some of their mapping data, known
  as <a href="http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/tools/guide">OpenStreetMap</a>.
</ol>

<P>We will have a class discussion based on the above. Any remaining time will be devoted to ongoing work on your senior project.
