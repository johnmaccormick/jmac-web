<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 10: Tuesday April 5, <b>7:00-8:30pm in Allison</b></FONT></h4>

There is no class at 3 PM today. Instead you are required to attend
the 7pm Clarke Forum panel session, "iPhone vs FBI: government
surveillance in the post-Snowden era."  Make sure to take a few notes
at the session (say, one page of notes). You'll be using these notes
to answer a brief Moodle assignment--similar to a reading quiz--that
will be published after the session and due by 11:59pm 4/6.

Note: you are encouraged, but not required, to use the 3-5pm timeslot
today for making progress on your project.  I will be available for
meetings throughout that time slot.

There is no class on Tuesday, April 12. Instead you are required to
attend and present a poster at the Dickinson science symposium on
Thursday, April 14, 4:30-6:00pm.

Note: you are encouraged, but not required, to use the 3-5pm timeslot
on Tuesday 4/12 for making progress on your project.  I will be

<P>Instructor-led discussion, on Ken Thompson's classic 1984 paper,
 originally delivered as the acceptance lecture for his Turing award:
 <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358210">Reflections on
 trusting trust</a>, Communications of the ACM, Volume 27 Issue 8, Aug
 1984, pages 761-763 (click on the "PDF" link). Notes:

<ul>
  <li>A full copy of the program presented by Thompson in Figure 1 of
  the paper is also
  available: <a href="thompson-program.c">thompson-program.c</a>
  (actually, this is a simplified and adapted version of the program
  but uses the same ideas).
  <li> We will do an ungraded minilab in class. In addition to the
  above <a href="thompson-program.c">thompson-program.c</a> we may
  also use the following tools for working with self-reproducing
  programs: <a href="self-rep-tools.zip">self-rep-tools.zip</a>.
</ul>

 

<!-- This class will consist of two separate discussion sessions led by the instructor: -->

be able to make it! Optional reading: the classic 1959 talk about the
future of computing by Nobel-winning physicist Richard
Feynman, <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~yang/RFeynman_plentySpace.pdf">There's
Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a> (this talk has its
own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom">Wikipedia
page</a> too). The reading is optional. There will not be a reading quiz!
