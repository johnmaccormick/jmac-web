    <h2>Grocery and shopping information</h2>

For grocery and other shopping, here are a few good options relative
to your accommodation at the University Village:

<ul>
  <li>Closest:
    The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/trgSDLHQ2BN2">Co-op</a> at
    Fiveways. There is also a Tesco Metro here, but I think the Co-op
    may be a little bigger and better. Almost equally close is the
    on-campus grocery store
    called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/84VtpDQ2PBK2">ShopSU</a>.
  <li>A little further away, but bigger and better:
    The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CKop4bUNCPP2">Co-op</a> at the
    junction of Earlham and Recreation Roads. Not too far to walk and
    also directly on the number 26 bus line.
  <li>Biggest but furthest:
    The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kQiDC35wNs52">Morrisons</a> in
    the Riverside Retail Park, right at the end of the number 25 bus
    line. Takes a while to get there but the bus drops you right
    outside a big store that has everything, a bit like Walmart.
    <li>Cheapest: The discount grocery
      store <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GB1ivhdTfzH2">ALDI</a> is a
      good option for low-cost groceries. It's a 20 minute walk from
      the Village and not easily accessible by bus from the Village.
    <li>Of course there are many excellent stores in the city center,
    which you can reach on the number 25 or number 26 bus lines. The
    best-known department stores are: Jarrolds (an independent Norwich
    store), Debenhams (probably the cheapest), Marks and Spencer, John
      Lewis (a little more upscale but still good value).
</ul>
