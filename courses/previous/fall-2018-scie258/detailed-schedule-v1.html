<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Wednesday, August 29, 2018</FONT></h4>

<P><b>Required reading</b>. Fara, Introduction.

<P>On arrival at Heathrow, meet Profs MacCormick and/or Mitchell at the
arrivals area in Terminal 2 (see details in
the <a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=776893">flight
and arrival instructions document</a>). 

<P>At the meeting point, you will be given an envelope containing some
cash (probably about 100 pounds), a card containing emergency phone
numbers, and some printed instructions
("<a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=716437">Instructions
for the first day</a>") on how to get to the hotel via the
Underground plus other useful information and required activities for the day.

<P>You can leave your Norwich bag at the meeting point. The professors
will put you into small groups and instruct you to make your own way
to the hotel. Once at your hotel, use the afternoon to get some lunch,
get your cell phone working with a UK SIM card (or buy a new cell
phone if you want), and optionally buy your 16-25 Rail Pass.

<P>All-year students only: pick up your BRP from the post office.

<P>If problems arise during the afternoon, please call/text/email/WhatsApp
me. Or you can probably find me in the lobby of the Ridgemount.

<P>Optional reading: In addition to the above required reading, you
may want to do some background reading (Wikipedia is fine) on the
Magna Carta, Gutenberg Bible, Lindisfarne Gospels, or anything else
that interests you at
the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/events/treasures-of-the-british-library">Ritblat
Gallery</a>.
  
<P>6pm: Meet me at the Ritblat Gallery of the British Library. This is
our first academic event, so the academic travel expectations apply
(i.e. required reading is completed, bring your notebook and pen,
don't have your cell phone out, don't be late, make sure to note two
or three items for your timeline assignment.)

<P>Recommended: get a head start on the required reading for
tomorrow. This recommendation applies to every evening, since it will
usually be easier to complete the required reading the night before.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Thursday, August 30, 2018</FONT></h4>

<b>Required reading</b>. Fara I.1 Sevens and IV.4 Industries. As with
all assigned readings during our study trip, this must be completed
before our first academic event of the day. As always, take a few
notes on the reading. These notes should be hand-written and recorded
in your paper notebook. Remember, you are allowed to consult this
notebook during any quizzes.

<P>11:00am-11:30pm: UEA registration and visa check. This will be in
the lobby of the Ridgemount. Please arrive in approximately
alphabetical order by last name (A-M 11:00, N-Z 11:15am). The sciences
students are being processed after the humanities students, so timings
are approximate.

<P>Before you get on the tube: top up your Oyster card so that it has
at least 35 pounds of credit, and use this to buy a 7-day travel card
for zones 1 and 2. (You won't physically get a "travel card," but your
Oyster card will now give you unlimited travel within zones 1 and 2
for the next week, without requiring any additional credit.)
  
<P>2PM: London Science Museum visit. Meet outside the Group Entrance
  on Imperial College Road. We will enter as a group, and I will
  probably take you to see one or two of my favorite exhibits. After
  that, you are on your own to complete the following assignment (and
  also to enjoy the museum for as long as you want):
  <ul>
    <li><b>Science Museum assignment:</b> Find something in the museum
that is relevant either to your major or to some other course you have
taken at Dickinson. Make a few notes about it and be prepared to speak
for a few minutes. When finished, please meet with me in the basement
of the museum to report your results. You can find me in the basement
(that is, Level "-1"), probably in the Basement Cafe or the picnic
area. I will be there until about 4:30 PM. This assignment must be
done individually and you must not knowingly use the same topic as
another student. (Feel free to wander round the museum in groups, but
make sure to do this assignment individually.)
      </ul>
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, August 31, 2018</FONT></h4>

<P>9:45am: Meet in the lobby of the Wellcome Library building, 183
  Euston Rd, Bloomsbury, London NW1 2BE.

<P>10:00am: Guided tour of Wellcome Library and Collection.

<P>The rest of the day consists of optional activities. I encourage
you to join me for a lighthearted navigation exercise followed by a
reward at a pub near the hotel; but if you prefer to do your own thing
and/or focus on the required reading for tomorrow, that is absolutely
fine.

<P>For those who choose to stay with the group: After the Wellcome
Library tour we will take bus 205 over to Old Spitalfields Market and
eat lunch there. You will have been given an ungraded exercise (also
available <a href="hw/navigation-exercise.pdf">online</a> ) for
navigating in London, to be done in small groups of 2-4.  If we get
separated on the trip to Spitalfields or you need to find me after
lunch before you set off on the navigation exercise, I will be based
at the coffee shop
called <a href="https://departmentofcoffee.com/spitalfields">Department
of Coffee and Social Affairs</a> (6 Lamb St). If you complete the
navigation exercise, there is a reward. See the exercise for details.

      During the classroom session, you will be given an opportunity
  to complete
  the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJIA92J_g3D-wdbuyNM__LPUMCInsYbSvOYmCM0lHwJkJcFA/viewform?usp=sf_link">second-week
	survey</a> for the course.
    <li><b>Newton's <i>Principia</i>
	:</b>
      Use <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Principles_of_Natural_Philosophy_(1846)">Andrew
	Motte's 1729 translation of Newton's <i>Principia</i>
      </a> to complete
      the following activities:
      <ol>
	<li>(2 minutes) Look at the title page and contents. Anything interesting or surprising? 
	<li>(5 minutes) Click on "Axioms, or Laws of Motion," near the
	top of Book I. Read the italicized parts of the three laws
	carefully. Choose one of the three laws and translate it into
	your own words using clear modern English, writing your
	translation in your notebook. Use a mathematical formula if you wish.
	<li>(2 minutes) Click on "Section I: Of the method of first
	  and last ratios of quantities." Don't try to read or
	  understand the text. Scroll down to the first diagram, near
	  Lemma 2. Does this remind you of anything? If so, what?
	<li>(5 minutes) In Book III, click on "Propositions I-IX (Force of
	gravity)." Scroll down to "PROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII." Read
	just the italicized part. Scroll down to the next proposition,
	"PROPOSITION VIII. THEOREM VIII." Again, read just the
	italicized part. What is the modern name for these two
	propositions? Can you write down a mathematical formula that
	summarizes these propositions?

    <li><b>Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i> :</b> Use the
	<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species_(1859)">wikisource.org version of the first edition for <i>Origin of
	    Species</i>
	</a>, published in 1859, to complete the following
	activities. (Important note: we are looking only at the first
	edition here. Darwin significantly expanded the text for later
	editions.)
      <ol>
	<li>(2 minutes) The full title of this work contains 20 words. Write down
	the full meaning of the title in one or two sentences of your
	  own words, using plain modern English.
	<li>(3 minutes) Click on a couple of randomly chosen chapters and search
	the text for the words/phrases "evolution," "evolve," and
	  "survival of the fittest." Make a note of your results.
	<li>(10 minutes) Click on Chapter XI ("Geographical
	Distribution"). In this chapter, Darwin is trying to explain
	how, if life evolved from a single original location, it could
	spread around the world including to remote islands. Carefully
	read paragraphs 359-362 inclusive. Make a note of something
	striking or important in Darwin's (i) style of writing, and
	(ii) scientific and experimental technique.

<P><b>Required reading</b>. Fara, VII.1: Warfare + VII.4: Information. 

<P>Optional reading: If you have any interest in codebreaking during
World War II and/or Alan Turing, you can enhance your visit to
Bletchley Park by reading up beforehand. One place to start is
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley
Park</a> Wikipedia page,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8">Hut 8</a>.

<P>9:30am: Meet under the main departure boards at Euston station
  (train station, not the Euston Square tube station). Bring train tickets for
  Bletchley Park and 16-24 rail card. Exact meeting point: near The Body Shop.

your own for the rest of the afternoon. Join one or more of the free
guided tours if desired. The Bombe demonstration is strongly
recommended.

<P>Our day return train tickets are valid for any train back to
London, so make your own way back, allowing plenty of time if you are
participating in the Othello trip tonight. One possible train would be
the 2:52pm from Bletchley, arriving at London Euston 3:45pm.


<P>6:15pm: [For those going to Othello.] Meet outside the hotel on
Gower Street. We will travel together to the Globe for the start of
the play at 7:30 PM. I think you'll enjoy the play much more if you
try to understand the main points of the plot beforehand.  Wikipedia has a
good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello#Synopsis">synopsis</a>
on its Othello page.

    the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/galleries-and-museum-map/treasures-in-the-cadogan-gallery.html">Cadogan
    Gallery</a> of the Natural History Museum. Please check in with me
    there individually (we won't meet as a group). I won't be doing a
    formal quiz, but I will chat with you about the readings for today and yesterday,
    individually or in small groups. Be prepared, with the help of
    your notes, to contribute to a meaningful conversation that will
    form part of your PAE grade. After chatting with me, you can start
    the following assignment.

<P><b>Natural History Museum assignment</b>: Complete this assignment
  in your notebook, and be prepared to describe your results at a
  subsequent class meeting. Note that the museum is divided into three
  zones, as follows: Green Zone for birds, ecology, fossils,
  archaeology, minerals; Red Zone for volcanoes, earthquakes, early
  earth, evolution of life, geology, mineralogy, wind, water, weather;
  Blue Zone for dinosaurs, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals,
  marine invertebrates, human biology. There are two steps in the
  assignment:
  <ol>
    <li>Choose one of the items in the Cadogan Gallery. Give a clear
  one-sentence description of the item. Then write a paragraph or so
  describing its relevance to the history of science and connections
  to people, ideas, and historical forces we have studied in the
  course.
    <li>Find two other items elsewhere in the museum (not the Cadogan
    Gallery) that have relevance to your chosen Cadogan Gallery
    item. These two items must come from different Zones.  For each of the two
    items, give a clear one-sentence description and another sentence
    or two describing the connections to your Cadogan Gallery item.
  </ol>
  There is plenty more to see in the museum, of course. Follow your
  own interests after you complete the assignment.


<P>Afternoon, before 4:30pm: You are required to visit the Bank of
England Museum on Bartholomew Ln, London EC2R 8AH. (Don't go to the
main entrance of the bank on Threadneedle Street.) You may do this
visit any time this afternoon, on your own or in small groups. The
museum closes at 5 PM, with last admission 4:30 PM. As with any
academic event, make some notes in preparation for a subsequent
discussion. And don't miss out on the chance to hold a real bar of
gold!
