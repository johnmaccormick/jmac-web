    <h2>HW5c updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Room 31: Closed for refurbishment, so you can ignore all of the names in this room.
  <li>Room 32: It looks like all the rock stars have been removed. Of
  the names listed in the assignment, only Queen Elizabeth and
  Princess Diana are there.
  <li>Room 38: The contents have completely changed since the
  assignment was written, so you can ignore all of the names in this
    room.
    <li>(Optional) Room 6 has some good stuff in it that did not make
    it into the assignment. Look out for Robert Boyle, William Harvey,
    John Ray, and Thomas Hobbes, all of whom have cropped up in our
    readings and tours.
