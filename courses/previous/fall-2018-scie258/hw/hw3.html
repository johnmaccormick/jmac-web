      <LI>For events related to the humanities course, I'm really
	hoping you will talk in person with humanities students to get
	some ideas, but you can also get some background on their
	course from the
	HUMN209 <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~mitchelk/HUMN_209_syllabus_FA2018.pdf">syllabus</a>
	and <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~mitchelk/london_schedule.htm">schedule</a>.
      <li>HW3a will be worth 20 points and HW3b will be worth 80 points.
      <li><font color="red"><b>NEW on Sep 10:</b>
	</font> To further facilitate interaction with humanities
	students, I would like to offer the following incentive, which
	we might call "buy a drink for a humanities student." The
	Dickinson program will reimburse two beverages, one for you
	and one for a humanities student, on the condition that while
	consuming the beverages you spend some time discussing the
	humanities course and make note of a few relevant events for
	your
	timeline. A <a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=789028">list
	of humanities students</a> with email addresses is available
	on Moodle.  To claim reimbursement, write your name and the
	name of the humanities student on the receipt for the drinks,
	and submit them to the instructor before Tuesday October 2,
	2018. (Fine print: please keep the cost of the drinks
	reasonable, say no more than 10 or 15 pounds for two drinks.)
