    <h2>HW5</h2>

    These assignments are all on-site exercises. Electronic copies are
    provided here for convenience and completeness. Hard copies will
    be distributed at the relevant locations, so there's no need to
    read or print these in advance.

    <P>Most of these assignments are permitted to be done in
    teams. However, you can't work with the same teammate more than
    once. (Exceptions: for the navigation exercise and the Ghost
    Map/Lab of One's Own exercise, you can work with anyone you want,
    including teammates from other assignments.)
