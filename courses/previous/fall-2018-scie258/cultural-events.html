    <h2>Optional cultural events</h2>

As announced in separate messages early in the summer, two cultural
events are being offered as optional components of the SCIE258
course. While not directly related to the theme of our course, these
events will contribute to the more general goals of global study
through cultural understanding. The events are optional and will have
no effect on your course grade. The Dickinson program will fully fund these events.

      <LI><A HREF="https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e86v9r">Prom
      Concert</A> at the Royal Albert Hall at 7:30 PM on Monday,
      September 3. This is in a spectacular venue with a great program
      of 20th-century classical music by Bernstein and
      Shostakovich. We will be buying "promming" tickets for the
      standing room in front of the orchestra area. To buy these
      tickets, we need to queue up at least an hour in
      advance. Therefore, please meet in the queuing area at the Royal
      Albert Hall by 6:15 PM. Optionally, you can visit the theater
      earlier in the day to obtain a placeholder ticket that
      guarantees your place in the queue. Let the instructor know if
      you are interested in pursuing this option. </LI>
      <li>Shakespeare's <a href="http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on-2018/othello">Othello</a>
	  at the Globe theatre, 7:30 PM on Wednesday, September
	  12. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_Globe">Shakespeare's
	  Globe</a> is a reconstruction of the playhouse built and
	  used by Shakespeare's own theater company. We will be
	  standing in the open-air "yard" area, watching the play on
	  foot the same way most of the audience would have in
	  Shakespeare's time. If it rains, we will get wet! We will
	  travel to the theater as a group, leaving the Ridgemount
	  hotel at 6:15pm.
