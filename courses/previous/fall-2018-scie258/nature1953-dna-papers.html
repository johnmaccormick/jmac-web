    <H1>three papers from Nature, 25 April 1953, investigating the structure of DNA</H1>

    In class we will examine each of the following documents, but no prior reading is necessary.

    <h2>Instructions for the in-class activity</h2>

    You will be assigned one of the three papers above (Watson-Crick,
    Wilkins-Stokes-Wilson, Franklin-Gosling). With this paper:
      <ol>
	<li><i>Without consulting any other resource</i>, read the
	first and last paragraphs carefully and skim the rest. Look at
	any diagrams and equations carefully. To the best of your
	ability, write a few sentences describing the main topic and
	main new contribution of the paper. Also make a note of
	  anything interesting and unusual.
	<li>Now, feel free to do a few minutes of online research
	(Wikipedia or similar). Use the new information to give a more
	  accurate summary of the paper's main topic and contribution.
	<li>Meet with the other members of your group. Discuss your
	results from steps 1 and 2. Prepare a summary of your combined
	results, and nominate a leader who will present your results
	from steps 1 and 2 to the rest of the class.
