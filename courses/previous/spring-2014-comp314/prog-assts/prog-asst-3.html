    <H2>Programming assignment 3</H2>

    To turn in this assignment, please submit the single file
    <TT>Npda.java</TT> to Moodle.

<P>This assignment consists of a single task.  Download the code
  and documentation for <A HREF="prog-asst-3.zip">programming
  assignment 3</A>, and complete the
  <TT>Npda</TT> class so that the <TT>accept()</TT> method works
  correctly.  Naturally, the program should work not just on the
  provided test file (<TT>testnpda.txt</TT>), but on any other
  legitimate npda file.

  <P>Please edit and submit <I>only</I> the file <TT>Npda.java</TT>.  In
  addition, please add code only at the locations marked by the
  string <TT>PROGASST3</TT>.

<P>Completion of this assignment requires knowledge of (i)
  recursion, (ii) the Java <TT>Stack&lt;&gt;</TT> class, and (iii)
  the <TT>clone()</TT> method for Java objects.  These will be
  briefly discussed in class, but if this proves insufficient,
  please seek help from a classmate or the instructor. (The simple example of recursion discussed in class is available: <a href="Node.java">Node.java</a>.)

<P>The grade for this assignment will reflect: correctness of the code
(50%); elegance of the design (25%); legibility and quality of
comments (25%).  Please see the main programming assignment web page
for more details on what constitutes high-quality code.
