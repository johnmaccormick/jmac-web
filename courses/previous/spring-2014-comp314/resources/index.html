<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: Monday, January 20</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: The introductory reading 01-intro-reading.pdf is
available on Moodle.</a>.

<P>Example
code: <a href="class01-programs.zip">class01-programs.zip</a>.
(Individual programs are also available from the list of
all <a href="programs.html">sample code</a>.)

<P>Instructions
for <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/courses/previous/spring-2013-comp204/labs/python-overview.html">editing
and running Python programs on the lab machines</a>. (These
instructions were written for people with no CS background, so I
apologize if they seem unnecessarily laborious.)

<P>Some essential practice exercises:
<ul>
  <li>Over the next week or two, learn the basics of Python.  Pick
  your favorite online tutorial. The official Python site provides a
  good one, for
  example: <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html">http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html</a>.
  <li>Learn how to convert Python programs from function form to file
  form and vice versa.  Practice on
  e.g. <a href="countLines.py">countLines.py</a>.
</ul>

<P>Note on Python versions: All example code will work with Python
version 2.x. You can use Python 3.x if you want, but you will need to
change <tt>print ...</tt> to <tt>print(...)</tt>, and maybe some other
things too.



<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Thursday, January 23</FONT></h4>

<P>Lecture notes: <a href="class02-impossible-programs-v2.pdf">class02-impossible-programs.pdf</a>.

<P>Lecture notes: <a href="class03-turing-machines-v1.1.pdf">class03-turing-machines-v1.1.pdf</a>.

<P>Minilab: using JFLAP,
<ul>
  <li>Create and test the basic version of LastTtoA (figure 3 of the lecture notes)
  <li>Create and test the abbreviated version of LastTtoA (figure 4 of the lecture notes)
  <li>Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings,
  changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c"
  <li>Optional extras: (i) Create a machine that increments a binary
  number. (ii) Create a machine that accepts any string of length 10
  or more that also contains an "a".
</ul>

    <LI>Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the
      previous class, but using only the alphabet a,b (and blanks).
      If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of
      <a href="LastBtoA.jff">LastBtoA</a>.  We will use LastBtoA as an
      input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      <LI>Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas
      and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      An <A HREF="example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf">explanation
      of the encoding</A> is provided.  Lucas and Jarvis
      provide <A HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html">another
      explanation</A> on their website.</LI>

    <LI>Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an
    appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test
    is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple
    inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.</LI>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 26: Thursday, April 24.</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: Chapter 11 of <i>The Annotated Turing</i> by
Charles Petzold, available on Moodle.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 27: Monday, April 27.</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: Richard Karp's 1972 paper, <i>Reducibility Among
Combinatorial Problems</i>, available on Moodle. Obviously, you're not
expected to understand all details of this paper. Here's what you
should do to prepare for our discussion:
<ol>
  <li>Skim the whole paper, skipping over any technical definitions
  and formulas, just to get a feel for what is there.
  <li>Read pages 94-97 a bit more carefully, but still skipping over
  anything that seems tricky.
  <li>Choose 2 or 3 problems from the list of 21 problems on pages
  94-96. (Include at least one problem that we have not discussed in
  class.)  For each of your chosen problems, make sure you understand
  Karp's description of the problem.
  <li>Choose 1 reduction from the 20 reductions in the proof of the
  main theorem, pages 97-100.  (Don't choose one of the ones we have
  proved in class.) Understand the reduction to the best of your
  ability, and make some brief notes so that you can present an
  explanation of the reduction to the rest of the class. If there are
  some parts of the reduction you can't understand, that's OK -- just
  make a careful note of anything you don't understand, and include a
  description of this in your presentation plan.
</ol>


<!-- Required reading: Linz 1.2.   -->

<!-- <P>Note the definition of "language" given near the bottom of page -->
<!-- 18.  The lecture will emphasize two different views of what a -->
<!-- "language" can mean to a computer scientist: 1. a programming -->
<!-- language, and 2. the answer to a mathematical problem (more -->
<!-- specifically, a list of numbers that satisfy some given property, -->
<!-- such as being prime or being even). -->

<!-- <P>We will be using the following five languages as running examples -->
<!-- throughout the course: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--     <li><b>Java programs</b>, written in ASCII -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>an ASCII string is in the language if it can be compiled -->
<!-- 	by the Java compiler with no errors -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>HTML pages</b>, written in ASCII -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>an ASCII string is in the language if it is accepted by -->
<!-- 	the HTML validator -->
<!-- 	at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>. (Example -->
<!-- 	of page with an	error: <a href="deliberate-error.html">deliberate-error.html</a>) -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>multiples of 5</b>, written in decimal -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>a string of decimal digits is in the language if it -->
<!-- 	represents an integer that is a multiple of five -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>prime numbers</b>, written in decimal -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>a string of decimal digits is in the language if it -->
<!-- 	represents an integer that is a prime number -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>Java programs that can't crash</b> (i.e. throw a runtime exception) -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>an ASCII string is in the language if it can be compiled -->
<!-- 	by the Java compiler with no errors, and the resulting program -->
<!-- 	will never throw a runtime exception, no matter what input it -->
<!-- 	receives. -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--       </ol> -->
<!-- The main question is: what type of computers (i.e. automata) -->
<!-- can <i>recognize</i> these languages? -->


<!-- <P>Mini-lab to understand basics about grammars: -->
<!--   <UL> -->
<!--     <LI>fire up JFLAP.  Click on grammar.  Create your own grammar.  (Use S as the start symbol. Use uppercase letters as variables, lowercase letters as terminal symbols.) </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Choose "multiple brute force parse".  In the frame on the right, in the input column, enter a string you believe is in the language defined by your grammar.  Click "run inputs" and check that "accept" is the result.  </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Now click "start" in the top-left frame.  Click "step" a few times.  Switch between inverted tree and derivation table, try to understand what is being shown here.  </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Step through the derivation of another string that is in your language; this time ensure the string has length at least 4.  </LI> -->

<!-- Required reading: Linz 2.1.   -->

<!-- <\!-- <P>The lecture will briefly mention some of the material in Linz -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 1.3, but this section is not required reading. -\-> -->

<!-- <P>Mini-lab using JFLAP to investigate -->
<!-- some rudimentary dfas: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>In JFLAP, create a dfa that accepts strings of one or more 'a's, optionally preceded by a single 'b'. -->
<!--   <li>Test your dfa using "multiple run". -->
<!--   <li>Does your dfa have transitions for every possible input?  If -->
<!--   not, it is incomplete, according to the definition given in our -->
<!--   textbook, but JFLAP allows this kind of incomplete dfa.  What is the -->
<!--   interpretation of a missing transition? -->
<!--   <li>If your dfa is complete, delete a few transitions to make it -->
<!--   incomplete.  Now use the "add trap state" functionality to complete -->
<!--   it. -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 5: Monday, February 7</FONT></h4> -->

<!-- Required reading: Linz 2.2. -->

<!-- <P><b>A note on nondeterminism:</b> Nondeterminism does not exist in -->
<!-- any real computer. It is a theoretical concept that we introduce for -->
<!-- <i>convenience</i>, because it is often much easier to prove facts -->
<!-- about nondeterministic automata, compared to deterministic automata. -->
<!-- There are two useful ways to think about nondeterminism: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>Imagine a computer with supernatural powers that can examine -->
<!--   multiple possibilities at the same time. For example, consider a -->
<!--   supernatural chess computer that could simultaneously analyze the -->
<!--   consequences of 10 different possible moves.  Instead of having to -->
<!--   make a -->
<!--   <i>deterministic</i> choice about which of the 10 moves to analyze, -->
<!--   this computer can make a <i>nondeterministic</i> choice to analyze -->
<!--   all 10 moves at once! -->
<!--   <li>It is always possible to simulate nondeterminism on a real -->
<!--   computer, in the following way. Whenever a (supernatural) computer -->
<!--   wants to make a nondeterministic choice, we just make a list of the -->
<!--   possible choices available, and store them in a queue in our (real) -->
<!--   computer's memory.  Then, analyze each of the choices one at time. -->
<!--   If further nondeterministic choices are encountered, add them to the -->
<!--   queue and analyze them later too. -->
<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- <P>JFLAP mini-lab to investigate -->
<!-- non-determinism: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>In JFLAP, implement an nfa that accepts the language: {<i>aaa</i> or an -->
<!--   even number of <i>a</i>'s} -->
<!--   <li>Use the "step with closure" option to see how the nfa processes -->
<!--   the following two strings: <i>aaaaa</i>, and <i>aaaa</i>.  You will -->
<!--   repeatedly click on the "step" button to do this. Once you -->
<!--   understand the effect of the "step" button, investigate the effect -->
<!--   of the other buttons (reset, freeze, thaw, trace, and remove). -->
<!--   <li>Now practice using nondeterminism that arises from transitions -->
<!--   on the empty string. Implement an nfa for the language -->
<!--   {<i>aaaa</i>, <i>aaaba</i>}, using at least one transition on the -->
<!--   empty string.  Use "step with closure" to investigate the workings -->
<!--   of this nfa. -->
<!--   <li>Add more nondeterminism to your nfa.  Practice stepping through -->
<!--   sets of states, freezing and/or removing some of them. -->
<!-- </ol> -->


<!-- <h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6: Thursday, February 10</FONT></h4> -->

<!-- Required reading: Linz 2.3. -->

<!-- <P>We will do two JFLAP mini-labs to practice converting between nfas -->
<!-- and dfas, based on examples from Linz. JFLAP files for these Linz -->
<!-- examples are available: -->
<!-- <A HREF="fig2.12.jff">fig2.12.jff</A>, and <A -->
<!-- HREF="fig2.14.jff">fig2.14.jff</A>. -->

<!-- <P>Important hints for using JFLAP to convert from an nfa to a dfa: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>Typically, you will only use the second tool, labeled "expand -->
<!--   group on terminal".  To use this tool, always click on an existing -->
<!--   state that needs a new transition, drag away from that state, and -->
<!--   release. -->
<!--   <li>The other tools can be used to skip some steps and complete the -->
<!--   conversion more quickly, but they won't help you to learn the -->
<!--   algorithm. -->
<!--   <li>JFLAP doesn't let you insert trap states during the conversion -->
<!--   from nfa to dfa, so you can ignore transitions that end in the empty -->
<!--   set of states.  Once the conversion is complete, use the "add trap -->
<!--   state" functionality to obtain a complete dfa. -->
<!--   <li>More help is available from the -->
<!--   online <a href="http://www.jflap.org/tutorial/">JFLAP tutorial</a> -->
<!--   (click on "Finite Automata", then "Convert to DFA"). -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <P>Optional extension to this minilab: play around with the "minimize -->
<!-- dfa" functionality. One very interesting example is the one we tried -->
<!-- in Class 5: first create an nfa for the language on {a,b} that accepts -->
<!-- any string containing "aaaba".  Now convert that nfa to a dfa.  Now -->
<!-- minimize the resulting dfa.  Do you get the same results we got by -->
<!-- hand? -->

<!-- <P>Main thing to think about from today's class: recall our five running -->
<!-- examples of interesting languages (Java programs, HTML pages, -->
<!-- multiples of 5, prime numbers, Java programs that can't crash), and -->
<!-- add to this list a 6th important example, which is just the complement -->
<!-- of number 5: Java programs that <i>can</i> crash.  Of these six -->
<!-- languages, which ones are recursively enumerable? Which ones are -->
