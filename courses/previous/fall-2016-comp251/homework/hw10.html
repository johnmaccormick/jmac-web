  <h2>HW10</h2>

<P>Homework 10 is our final homework assignment. You may attempt this
assignment in pairs or individually. You may not use late days for
this assignment, but an automatic free extension is being granted: you
may turn in the assignment up until 11:59 PM on the Friday of the last
day of classes.  The assignment must be submitted in hard copy. It
should consist of printouts of the "<tt>.hdl</tt>" files described
below.

<P>Note that a significant fraction of class time for the last three
classes will be available to work on Homework 10, and of course you
can get individual help from the instructor during these classes.

<P>Homework 10 consists of a hardware design project based on the
  first chapter of the
  book <i><a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">Elements of Computing
  Systems</a></i>, by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.  All the necessary resources
  are available on this
  book's <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php">course</a>
  page.  You will need to:
<ol>
  <li>Download the necessary software from the
  <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php">software</a> link
  at that site.  
  <li>Read Chapter 1 of the book (linked from
  the <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php">course</a>
  page). 
  <li>Skim sections 1-6 of Appendix A (also linked from
  the <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php">course</a>
  page).  
  <li>Complete Parts I, II, and III of the hardware
  simulator tutorial (search for "hardware simulator tutorial" at
  the <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php">software</a>
  page.  
  <li>Now you are ready to begin the homework assignment,
  which is a portion of "Project 1" (also linked from
  the <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php">course</a>
  page).
</ol>

<P>Grading of this project will be as follows:
<ol>
  <li><tt>Not.hdl</tt> (10 points)
  <li><tt>And.hdl</tt> (10 points)
  <li><tt>Or.hdl</tt> (10 points)
  <li><tt>Xor.hdl</tt> (10 points)
  <li><tt>Mux.hdl</tt> (10 points)
  <li><tt>DMux.hdl</tt> (10 points)
  <li>Optionally, for extra credit, you may complete some or all of
  the remaining <tt>.hdl</tt> files listed as part of the project
  (e.g. <tt>Not16.hdl</tt>, <tt>And16.hdl</tt>,
  etc.). Each correct <tt>.hdl</tt> file submitted will receive 5
  points of extra credit. (But note that extra credit cannot be used
    to raise your homework score for the semester above 100%.)
  <li>May I suggest that you continue on to Project 2? You will find
  it extremely interesting and worthwhile! (I can't offer extra credit
  for it, unfortunately.)  In fact, I strongly recommend completing
  the entire course based on this book. You can do it on your own or
  as a formal online course
  via <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>.  Why not try
  it over the winter break?  If you do, please let me know how far you
  got and what you think of the experience.
