  <h2>HW5</h2>
  <P>Class 14:
<UL>
  <li>4.36 (Write a MARIE subroutine...) 30 points
</UL>

<P>Class 16 (this homework question is not taken from the textbook --
label it as "class 16 homework" -- it's worth 30 points):
<UL>
<li>Write a MARIE assembly language program with the following
properties. There is a location labelled <TT>N</TT> storing a
positive integer <TT>n</TT>. There is a label <TT>Array</TT> marking
the start of an array containing <TT>n</TT> integers. There is a
location labelled <TT>Value</TT> storing an integer
<TT>value</TT>. There is a label <TT>Answer</TT> that will store the
answer of the computation. The program must output (i.e. store in
<TT>Anwser</TT>) the number of elements of the array which are greater
than <TT>value</TT>. You may assume that <TT>Value</TT> and all
elements of the array are nonnegative.  The program must use the
subroutine you wrote as the solution to the textbook exercise
4.36.  <B>Important hint:</B> manipulating arrays in MARIE requires
some special tricks. Look carefully
at <A HREF="../resources/arrayDemo.zip">arrayDemo.zip</A> in order to understand
the techniques you will need.
