      <LI>Exercise 1.2 (15 points)</LI>
      <LI>(Ungraded) Exercise 2.1. Some additional specific suggestions for this exercise are as follows. I like the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming">Python Programming wikibook</a>. Or, choose
  one of the other tutorials from the list at
  <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers">https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers</a>.</LI>
      <LI>(Ungraded) Work through all the practical exercises suggested in
	Sections 2.  In particular, this includes:
	<ul>
  <li> Change the outputs of <tt>containsGAGA.py</tt> to be
    <tt>yep</tt> and <tt>nope</tt>. Test it, then return
    <tt>containsGAGA.py</tt> to its original form.
  <li> Run <tt>containsGAGA.py</tt> using the contents of
    <tt>geneticString.txt</tt> as input.
  <li> Create a new Python program, <tt>temp.py</tt>, that executes
    <tt>containsGAGA</tt> on several different inputs, including the
    contents of <tt>geneticString.txt</tt>, and prints the results of
    each.
  <li> Run <tt>countLines.py</tt> and <tt>longestWord.py</tt> on the
    contents of <tt>wasteland.txt</tt>.
  <li> Run each of the five programs in
    Figure 2.5, and verify that the
    expected error or misbehavior is observed.</LI>
	</ul>
