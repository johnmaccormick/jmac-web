    <H2>Homework assignments</H2>

<P>The number of points assigned to a problem is a very approximate
guide to the number of minutes should take to solve the problem
(e.g. a 10-point question should take approximately 10 minutes).  As
stated on the syllabus, some questions will be graded on correctness
and some on completeness.  Only a random subset of questions will be
graded at all.  Solutions are provided on Moodle and it is the
  student's responsibility to check the solutions to all questions.

<P>You can use the <A HREF="hw-revision-cover-sheet.pdf">homework
      revision cover sheet</A> to earn back 50&#37; of the points you
      lost on any assignment. You can do this for every assignment if
      you want. (Exception: sorry, but you cannot submit a revision
      for homework assignment J.)  Revisions for homework assignments
      must be submitted within two weeks of the graded assignment
      being returned, or by noon on Tuesday, May 10, whichever is
      earlier.</LI>

      <LI><A HREF="hwJ.pdf">homework assignment J</A>. Note that there
      is no homework assignment "I". (Airlines and theaters often do
      the same thing -- seats go straight from H to J, to avoid "I"
      which looks too much like the numeral "1".) This assignment comes
      with a free one-day extension -- submit by 11:59pm on Friday,
      May 6.
