    <H1>Detailed schedule and class resources</H1>


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: Monday, January 25</FONT></h4>

    <P><b>Class 1 was canceled due to the snowstorm. We will be
    combining the schedule for class 1 and class 2 into a compressed
    version of class 2, then continue as previously scheduled starting
    with class 3.</b>

<P>The textbook is called <i>What Can Be Computed?</i>, which we
    abbreviate as <i>WCBC</i>.  Part I of WCBC, and all of the sample
    programs are available on Moodle
    (filenames <tt>wcbc-part1-Jan22.pdf</tt>
    and <tt>wcbc-programs-1-18-2016.zip</tt>). Parts II and III of
    WCBC will be made available later in the semester.

<P>You can also purchase a printed copy of WCBC Part I for $10. To
order your printed copy, you must give $10 to me or to Tonya Miller in
  the department office by <strike>5PM Thursday, January 28</strike> midnight Friday,
January 29.  Please pay by cash, check to "John MacCormick" or PayPal
to jmac@dickinson.edu.
      
<P>Today we will go through the syllabus and an overview of the course,
corresponding to WCBC Chapter 1.

<P>If there's time, we will try to run and edit some Python programs
  using IDLE. Key points:
<ul>
  <li>Always use Version 3.x of Python for this course
  <li>You can download Python 3 and install it on your own laptop etc.
  <li>Python is also available on all department iMacs in Tome:
    <ul>
      <li>use Finder | MacPorts | Python 3.5 | IDLE
      <li>see the <a href="IDLE-screenshot.png">accompanying screenshot</a> if desired
      <li>you can ignore any warnings about the version of Tcl/Tk
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Thursday, January 28</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: Chapters 1 and 2 of WCBC.

<P>Warm-up: use containsGAGA.py to determine whether the
file <a href="CAGT.txt">CAGT.txt</a> contains the string "GAGA".

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 3: Monday, February 1</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 3.

  <li>Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings,
  changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c"
  <li>Optional extras: Create a machine that accepts any string of
  length 10 or more that also contains an "a".
</ul>

<!--   <li>Optional extras: (i) Create a machine that increments a binary -->
<!--   number. (ii) Create a machine that accepts any string of length 10 -->
<!--   or more that also contains an "a". -->



<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6: Thursday, February 11.</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 6.


<!-- <P>Lecture -->
<!-- notes: <a href="class06-rices-theorem-v2.pdf">class06-rices-theorem-v2.pdf</a>. -->

<!-- <P>HW1 solutions are available on Moodle. -->

<P>Minilab (ungraded, but important and fun):

  <UL>

    <LI>Download the
<!-- <A -->
<!--     HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/tu.jff">Universal -->
<!--     Turing machine</A> -->

 of Lucas and Jarvis (see also their <A
    HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg0.html">explanatory
    webpage</A> if you're interested).</LI>


    <LI>Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the
      previous class, but using only the alphabet a,b (and blanks).
      If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of
      <a href="LastBtoA.jff">LastBtoA</a>.  We will use LastBtoA as an
      input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      <LI>Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas
      and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      An <A HREF="example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf">explanation
      of the encoding</A> is provided.  Lucas and Jarvis
      provide <A HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html">another
      explanation</A> on their website.</LI>

    <LI>Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an
    appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test
    is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple
    inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.</LI>

<P>Thank you very much for the feedback in the midsemester survey. A
complete listing of responses is
available: <a href="all-responses.pdf">all-responses.pdf</a>.  As a
result of this, I will do my best to slow down a little in the
technical parts of lectures (it is a 60&#37;-40&#37; split on whether
lectures are "a little too fast" or "about right").  Most other
aspects of the course appear to be on track, but of course I take all
feedback seriously and will pay attention to all of the
suggestions. One important piece of feedback for students is that
75&#37; of students are not reading the relevant sections of the
textbook in advance. It will be extremely helpful for you to read the
textbook in advance, even if you find it difficult to understand.

<!-- <P>Required reading: Richard Karp's 1972 paper, <i>Reducibility Among -->
<!-- Combinatorial Problems</i>, available on Moodle. Obviously, you're not -->
<!-- expected to understand all details of this paper. Here's what you -->
<!-- should do to prepare for our discussion: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>Skim the whole paper, skipping over any technical definitions -->
<!--   and formulas, just to get a feel for what is there. -->
<!--   <li>Read pages 94-97 a bit more carefully, but still skipping over -->
<!--   anything that seems tricky. -->
<!--   <li>Choose 2 or 3 problems from the list of 21 problems on pages -->
<!--   94-96. (Include at least one problem that we have not discussed in -->
<!--   class.)  For each of your chosen problems, make sure you understand -->
<!--   Karp's description of the problem. -->
<!--   <li>Choose 1 reduction from the 20 reductions in the proof of the -->
<!--   main theorem, pages 97-100.  (Don't choose one of the ones we have -->
<!--   proved in class.) Understand the reduction to the best of your -->
<!--   ability, and make some brief notes so that you can present an -->
<!--   explanation of the reduction to the rest of the class. If there are -->
<!--   some parts of the reduction you can't understand, that's OK -- just -->
<!--   make a careful note of anything you don't understand, and include a -->

<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- <P>Update, 4:30pm 4/27/15: Chapter 17 of the textbook is now available -->
<!-- on Moodle. Given the late availability, this can be considered -->
<!-- optional reading. But it will probably help you to understand one or -->
<!-- two of Karp's reductions mentioned above, so I do recommend you take a -->
<!-- look at it either before class or after class. -->

<!-- about nondeterministic automata, compared to deterministic automata. -->
<!-- There are two useful ways to think about nondeterminism: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>Imagine a computer with supernatural powers that can examine -->
<!--   multiple possibilities at the same time. For example, consider a -->
<!--   supernatural chess computer that could simultaneously analyze the -->
<!--   consequences of 10 different possible moves.  Instead of having to -->
<!--   make a -->
<!--   <i>deterministic</i> choice about which of the 10 moves to analyze, -->
<!--   this computer can make a <i>nondeterministic</i> choice to analyze -->
<!--   all 10 moves at once! -->
<!--   <li>It is always possible to simulate nondeterminism on a real -->
<!--   computer, in the following way. Whenever a (supernatural) computer -->
<!--   wants to make a nondeterministic choice, we just make a list of the -->
<!--   possible choices available, and store them in a queue in our (real) -->
<!--   computer's memory.  Then, analyze each of the choices one at time. -->
<!--   If further nondeterministic choices are encountered, add them to the -->
<!--   queue and analyze them later too. -->
<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- <P>JFLAP mini-lab to investigate -->
<!-- non-determinism: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>In JFLAP, implement an nfa that accepts the language: {<i>aaa</i> or an -->
<!--   even number of <i>a</i>'s} -->
<!--   <li>Use the "step with closure" option to see how the nfa processes -->
<!--   the following two strings: <i>aaaaa</i>, and <i>aaaa</i>.  You will -->
<!--   repeatedly click on the "step" button to do this. Once you -->
<!--   understand the effect of the "step" button, investigate the effect -->
<!--   of the other buttons (reset, freeze, thaw, trace, and remove). -->
<!--   <li>Now practice using nondeterminism that arises from transitions -->
<!--   on the empty string. Implement an nfa for the language -->
<!--   {<i>aaaa</i>, <i>aaaba</i>}, using at least one transition on the -->
<!--   empty string.  Use "step with closure" to investigate the workings -->
<!--   of this nfa. -->
<!--   <li>Add more nondeterminism to your nfa.  Practice stepping through -->
<!--   sets of states, freezing and/or removing some of them. -->
<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- Required reading: Linz 2.3. -->

<!-- <P>We will do two JFLAP mini-labs to practice converting between nfas -->
<!-- and dfas, based on examples from Linz. JFLAP files for these Linz -->
<!-- examples are available: -->
<!-- <A HREF="fig2.12.jff">fig2.12.jff</A>, and <A -->
<!-- HREF="fig2.14.jff">fig2.14.jff</A>. -->

<!-- <P>Important hints for using JFLAP to convert from an nfa to a dfa: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>Typically, you will only use the second tool, labeled "expand -->
<!--   group on terminal".  To use this tool, always click on an existing -->
<!--   state that needs a new transition, drag away from that state, and -->
<!--   release. -->
<!--   <li>The other tools can be used to skip some steps and complete the -->
<!--   conversion more quickly, but they won't help you to learn the -->
<!--   algorithm. -->
<!--   <li>JFLAP doesn't let you insert trap states during the conversion -->
<!--   from nfa to dfa, so you can ignore transitions that end in the empty -->
<!--   set of states.  Once the conversion is complete, use the "add trap -->
<!--   state" functionality to obtain a complete dfa. -->
<!--   <li>More help is available from the -->
<!--   online <a href="http://www.jflap.org/tutorial/">JFLAP tutorial</a> -->
<!--   (click on "Finite Automata", then "Convert to DFA"). -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <P>Optional extension to this minilab: play around with the "minimize -->
<!-- dfa" functionality. One very interesting example is the one we tried -->
<!-- in Class 5: first create an nfa for the language on {a,b} that accepts -->
<!-- any string containing "aaaba".  Now convert that nfa to a dfa.  Now -->
<!-- minimize the resulting dfa.  Do you get the same results we got by -->
<!-- hand? -->
