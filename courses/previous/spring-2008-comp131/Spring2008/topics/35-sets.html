<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p>
<a href="../examples/StudentDatabase-v1.zip"><i>StudentDatabase-v1</i></a> (<code>ArrayList</code> based)<br>
<a href="../examples/StudentDatabase-v2.zip"><i>StudentDatabase-v2</i></a> (<code>HashMap</code> based)<br>
<a href="../examples/FirstForEach.zip"><i>FirstForEach</i></a><br>

<h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
<p>
    Use the <i>StudentDatabase-v2</i></a>
    project to complete the following refactorings:
    <ul>
    <li> update the <code>toString</code> and <code>print</code>
    methods of the <code>Student</code> class to work correctly with the 
    changes from the practice exercises of the last class meeting.
    <li> add a method called <code>deleteCourseByInstructor</code>
     to the <code>Student</code> class.  This method should take the name
    of an instructor as a parameter, and should delete the first course taught
    by that instructor from a student's schedule.
    Note that the <code>HashMap</code> class does have a <code>remove</code>
    method - consult the javadoc documentation for <code>HashMap</code> to
    see how to use this method.
    <li> record test cases for <code>deleteCourseByInstructor</code>
     method.  Note that you can check whether a course is in a student's
     schedule by using the <code>isTaking</code> method.
    </ul>

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>
    Using the <i>LibraryDB</i>
    project that you have been developing for the last three homeworks,
    complete the refactoring that you began in the previous homework.
    That is, update the <code>hasBookByAuthor</code>, 
    <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code>, <code>print</code> and
    <code>countBooksBySubject</code> methods of the <code>Library</code> class
    to work correctly with the <code>books</code> field as a 
    <code>HashMap</code>.
<p>
    Hint: comment out the method you had previously added when refactoring
    <code>hasBookByAuthor</code> and <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code>
    (for finding the position of a <code>Book</code> by author), and
    replace it with a method that takes an author's name as a parameter and
    returns a call number or
    an indication that the <code>Book</code> was not found.  Be sure to include
    a javadoc comment for this new method.
<p>
    NOTE: for any method definition that you need to change, do NOT delete
    the previous version of the method body.  Instead, simply comment it out
    using <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> comments so that it will be
    ignored by the compiler, and then put the new version of the method below
    the old version.  Failure to comply with these instructions will result in
    an immediate 15 point deduction.
<p>
    Hints:
    <ul>
    <li> the <code>HashMap</code> class does have a remove method - consult
     the documentation to see how the method works.
    <li> run your tests to verify that the program still works correctly.
    </ul>
<p>
Submit your <i>LibraryDB</i> project via Web-CAT.
