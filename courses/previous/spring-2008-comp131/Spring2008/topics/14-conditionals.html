<H3>Practice Exercises</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Modify the <code>deposit</code> method in the
    <code>Account</code> class from the <i>Account-v3</i> project
    so that it prints an error message and does not update the balance
    if a negative amount of money is deposited.
<li> Write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the 
    <code>deposit</code> method in the 
    <code>Account</code> class from the <i>Account-v3</i> project.
<li> Modify the <code>print</code> method in the
    <code>Account</code> class from the <i>Account-v3</i> project
    so that it prints the account balance in cents if the balance is 
    less than 1 dollar, and in dollars (as it does now) if the balance is a 
    dollar or more.
<li> (Challenge Exercise) 
 The <code>withdraw</code> method of the <i>Account-v3</i> project
 currently displays the error message "Error: there are only 1 cents
 in this account!" if the account has a balance of one cent and the user
 tries to withdraw more than that.  Modify the method so that it displays
 "Error: there is only 1 cent in this account!" in this situation, but
 still uses the original error message for any other account balance.
 <p>
 Hint: you can nest if statements inside other if statements.
<li> Add additional test case(s) as needed to achieve statement coverage
 for the modified <code>withdraw</code> method from the previous exercise.
<li> Use the <i>better-ticket-machine</i> project (from Chapter 2) to
do Exercises 2.43, 2.44 and 2.47
 in Barnes &amp; Kolling
<li>  Add a test class for the <i>better-ticket-machine</i>
 project and write test cases for the 
 <code>insertMoney</code> method that cover all statements in 
  the method.
</ol>

<H3>Homework Assignments</H3>
<p>
Download and unzip the BlueJ project <a href = "../examples/EmployeePay.zip">
 <i>EmployeePay</i></a>, open it in BlueJ and examine the code for class
<code>Employee</code> within this project.  This class will be used
 to calculate weekly paycheck amounts, with hours worked above and beyond
 the normal work week being payed a higher rate.  The fields of the
 class, the constructor and four accessor methods are provided for you:
<ul>
<li> the <code>name</code> field holds the name of the employee
<li> the <code>rate</code> field holds the hourly pay rate (in dollars)
     for this employee
<li> the <code>standardHours</code> field holds the minimum number of hours
     worked per week needed to qualify for overtime pay
     (i.e. any hours worked beyond this will be paid at the overtime rate)
<li> the <code>multiplier</code> field holds the amount to multiply the 
     hourly wage by for overtime hours.
       For example, to pay "time and a half" for overtime hours, this 
       field should be set to 1.5.
</ul>

Use this project to complete the following tasks:
<ul>
<li> complete the implementation of the <code>giveRaise</code> method, 
     which increases the employee's pay rate by the specified amount
<li> complete the implementation of the <code>calculateWeeklyPay</code> method
     that takes the number of hours
     worked for the week as a parameter, and returns the paycheck amount
     for the week.  For example, suppose we are using 
     using an <code>Employee</code>  with a 40 hour work week,
     an $8/hr pay rate and a pay multiplier of 1.5.  
     If this method is passed 45 (hours) when called using this employee, it
     should return 380.0, which is 40 * 8 + (45 - 40) * 8 * 1.5.
     On the other hand, if the method is passed 30 (hours) 
     in this situation, it should return 240.0, which is just 30 * 8 (i.e.,
     no overtime hours were worked).
    <p>
    Hint: you will need to use an if statement in this method!
<li> add a test class for class <code>Employee</code>
  that tests the constructor and covers all statements of 
  the <code>giveRaise</code> and <code>calculateWeeklyPay</code> methods.
</ul>
<p>
Submit this project via WebCAT.  Note that WebCAT will not accept your
submission if you have not created a test class for class 
<code>Employee</code>.
