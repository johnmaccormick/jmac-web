<h3>Practice Exercises</h3>

<p>

</p><ol>
<li>If it was not done as an example in class, study the <code>getMaxPrice</code> in the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class.  This method does not take any parameters and returns a <code>double</code> value indicating the maximum price for the stock during the period being analyzed.

<LI>Add a method named <code>getMinPrice</code> to the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class.  This method does not take any parameters and returns a <code>double</code> value indicating the minimum price for the stock during the period being analyzed.

<UL>Note: The <code>StockAnalyzerTest</code> class already contains test methods for each of the methods that you are writing for these exercises.  You can run each test individually by right clicking on the <code>StockAnalyzerTest</code> class and choosing the appropriate test method.</UL>

<LI>Add a method named <code>getDayOfMaxPrice</code> to the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class. This method does not take any parameters and returns an <code>int</code> value indicating the index at which the maximum price occurs. If there are multiple days that tie for the maximum price the index of the most recent day with that price should be returned.

<li>Add a method named <code>getDayOfMinPrice</code> to the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class. This method does not take any parameters and returns an <code>int</code> value indicating the index at which the minimum price occurs.  If there are multiple days that tie for the minimum price the index of the most recent day with that price should be returned.

<LI>Add a method named <code>getLargestPriceDifference</code> to the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class. This method does not take any parameters and returns a <code>double</code> value indicating the largest difference between any two prices that occurred within the period being analyzed. Note that if the lowest price occurred before the highest price then the value returned by this method will be positive. If the highest price occurs first then the value returned by this method will be negative. Hint: use <code>this</code> to call other methods of
the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class to do some of the work.

<LI>Add a method named <code>isVolatilePeriod</code> to the <code>StockAnalyzer</code> class. This method accepts one parameter, an <code>int</code> value specifying a number of days.  This method then returns <code>true</code> if the maximum and minimum prices are separated by no more than the specified number of days of each other, and <code>false</code> otherwise.

<li>Do Exercises 4.49-4.53 in Barnes &amp; Kolling </li>

<li>Create test methods for the methods that you just added to the <code>LogAnalyzer</code> class in exercises 4.49-4.52. Your test methods must achieve statement coverage for your methods.</li>

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

<p>
</p>

<OL>

<li>Complete the following exercises using the <i>GradeBook</i> project that you have been working with for the past two homework assignments. Note that if you had problems with the previous homework assignment, you should use the available solutions to correct your work before completing this assignment.

<ol type="a">

<li>Add a method named <code>findHomeworkAverage</code> to the <code>GradeBook</code> class. This method does not take any parameters and returns an <code>int</code> value indicating the average of all of the homework scores. Any fractional part of the average is truncated.  Also add test methods that achieve statement coverage for your <code>findHomeworkAverage</code> method.

<LI>Add a method named <code>findHomeworkMin</code> to the <code>GradeBook</code> class. This method does not take any parameters and returns an <code>int</code> value indicating the lowest homework score. Also add test methods that achieve statement coverage for your <code>findHomeworkMin</code> method.</li>

<LI>Add a method named <code>findIndexOfHomeworkMax</code> to the <code>GradeBook</code> class. This method does not take any parameters and returns an <code>int</code> value indicating the index of the highest homework score.  If there are ties for the highest homework score, this method returns the index of the most recent homework with that score.  Assume that older homework scores are stored at lower indices. Also add test methods that achieve statement coverage for your <code>findIndexOfHomeworkMax</code> method.

</li>

<LI>Add a method named <code>isHomeworkConsistent</code> to the <code>GradeBook</code> class.  This method takes one parameter that is an <code>int</code> value specifying the maximum allowable difference of the homework scores from the average homework score. This method then returns <code>true</code> if all of the homework scores differ from the average by no more than the specified maximum allowable difference, and <code>false</code> otherwise. Also add test methods that achieve statement coverage for your <code>isHomeworkConsistent</code> method.
</li>
