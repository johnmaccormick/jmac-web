<ol>
<li> Implement a <code>Pet</code> class that represents pets as follows:
<ol type = "a">
<li> use BlueJ to create a new project called <i>MyPet</i> that is stored in
 your <code>CS131</code> directory.
<li> create a new class called <code>Pet</code> in your <i>MyPet</i> project.
<li> in the <code>Pet</code> class, declare fields so that each instance of
 the class can keep track of the name, age (in months), weight, color and
 species of a pet.  Make sure that your class compiles correctly.
 Note that the fields should all be <code>private</code>.
<li> add a constructor that initializes all fields of a <code>Pet</code>
 object using parameters.  Compile your class, and create an instance of
 the class using the constructor that you just wrote.
<li> add a method called <code>print</code> that prints all information about
  a <code>Pet</code> on
     the screen.  Create an instance of the class and use it to call
     this method.
<li> add a mutator method called <code>increaseAge</code> to increase the age
 of a <code>Pet</code>.  This method should take the number of months to 
 increase the <code>Pet</code>'s age by as a parameter.
<li> add a method called <code>getAgeInYears</code> that returns the number
 of years old a <code>Pet</code> is, ignoring any fractional part.  For 
 example, if a
 <code>Pet</code> object having an age of 20 months is used to call this
 method, it should return 1.
<li> add a method called <code>printAge</code> that prints the age of the
 <code>Pet</code> in years and months.  For example, if a
 <code>Pet</code> object having an age of 20 months is used to call this
 method, it should print <code>1 year and 8 months</code>.
</ol>
Be sure to write javadoc comments for each constructor and method in your
<code>Pet</code> class.
<li> Use the <i>naive-ticket-machine</i> project (from Chapter 2) to
do Exercises 2.34 - 2.36
 in Barnes &amp; Kolling

<H3>Homework Assignments</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Using the <a href = "../examples/Account-v2.zip"><i>Account-v2</i></a>
sample project, modify the <code>print</code> method so that it does not use 
     <code>+</code> to concatenate any Strings, but still produces 
     exactly the same output.  Copy and paste your
     revised method definition into your answer for this exercise.
<p>
     Hints: use <code>System.out.print</code>, rather than 
      <code>System.out.println</code>.
 The following code:

<pre>
System.out.print("Using print");
System.out.println("instead");
System.out.print("of println");
</pre>

will produce this output:
<pre>
Using print instead
of println.
</pre>
<p>
You can also print out the value of a field by passing it as a
parameter to print.
For example: <code>System.out.print(balance);</code>
 will display the value of the <code>balance</code> field.
<li> In Java, what is the value of the following expression?: 
   <code>99 / 100</code><br>
    Describe how you could you use the <code>Account</code> class to check your answer without changing any of its code?
<li> In Java, what is the value of the following expression?: 
     <code>99 % 21</code>
<li> Implement a <code>Computer</code> class that represents computers as
  follows:
<ol type = "a">
<li> use BlueJ to create a new project called <i>MyComputer</i> that is stored
  in your <code>CS131</code> directory.
<li> create a new class called <code>Computer</code> in your <i>MyComputer</i>
  project.
<li> in the <code>Computer</code> class, declare fields so that each instance of
 the class can keep track of the manufacturer,
 amount of main memory (in MB or millions of bytes),
 and amount of hard drive storage (in GB or billions of bytes) of a computer.
 Make sure that your class compiles correctly.
 Note that the fields should all be <code>private</code>.
<li> add a constructor that initializes all fields of a <code>Computer</code>
 using parameters.  
<li> add a method called <code>getMainMemory</code> that returns the 
 amount of main memory in the computer in gigabytes (GB or billions of bytes),
 not megabytes (MB).  Note that 1 GB is 1024 MB.  Any fractional part of
 a gigabyte should be ignored.  For example, if the computer has 1500 MB
 of main memory, the <code>getMainMemory</code> method should return 1.
<li> add a method called <code>print</code> that prints all information about
  a <code>Computer</code> on the screen. 
  For example, for a Dell computer with 
  512 MB of main memory and a 40 GB hard drive, the method 
 could print: "A Dell computer with 512 MB of memory and a
 40 GB hard drive."
</ol>
Be sure to write comments for each constructor and method in your
<code>Computer</code> class (use those in the <code>Account</code> class as a guide.
Also be sure to test the constructor and each method to be sure they work.
  Turn in a printout of your <code>Computer</code> class as your answer
 for this problem.
