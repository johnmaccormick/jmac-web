This series of pages describes the technological developments that led
to modern electronic computers.  Some of these pages use some advanced terminology. Try not to get too bogged down with that.  Read them and get out of them what you can.  Also, these pages are part of a larger Web-book on computational science sponsored by the US Department of Energy.  Some of the later material focuses particularly on advanced computing technology used to run scientific simulations.
