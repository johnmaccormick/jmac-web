COMP 131 is the entry point in Dickinson's Computer Science curriculum
for students with no previous programming experience. There are no
prerequisites for COMP 131.  If you have taken a Computer Science course or
have prior programming experience please consult with your instructor to see
if COMP 132 may be a more appropriate course for you.

<hr>
<A NAME="course format"></A>
<B>Course Format</B>
<P> Class will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and
time spent working semi-independently on the computer ---
completing in-class exercises, experimenting with existing programs,
and completing lab assignments.

<P><b>Homework assignments</b> will be made on a (near) daily basis.  
Homework will be due at the beginning of class on the due date.  All 
homework exercises will be collected, but only selected exercises will be 
graded.  All homework assignments must be typed (unless otherwise specified).

<P><b>Lab assignments</b> will be due at midnight of the day before
the next lab period (unless otherwise specified).  In other words,
labs will typically be due on Tuesday at midnight. All answers to the
(non-programming) lab exercises must be typed.  Most program code will
be submitted through the WebCAT on-line grading system.  You should
not turn in printouts of code that has been submitted through WebCAT.

<p><b>Late submissions of homework and labs</b>: Each student is
permitted a total of two no-penalty days of lateness over the entire
semester; every subsequent day of lateness incurs a 25% penalty for
the late assignment.

<P>Partial credit will be earned for making an honest effort on homework
exercises and labs. On the other hand, solutions to conceptual and computational
problems involve logical reasoning, and logical reasoning is
communicated using words as well as logical symbols and program code.
Therefore, full credit will be earned for solutions only when they are
expressed in a clear, legible, and grammatically correct fashion, and
when they are accompanied by explanations of the reasoning that led to
them. In particular, answers consisting of only sentence fragments do
not constitute complete solutions and so will not be graded as complete
solutions.

<P>As a practical matter, you will want to back up all of your work.
This could save you much frustration in case your files are
accidentally corrupted or deleted. In addition, the files you create in
some labs will be used in later ones; having copies of all
of your work will keep you from having to re-do the work on which these
labs build. Warning: Not having backed up your work is
<B><I>not</I></B> an acceptable reason for failing to submit an
assignment.  
<hr>
<A NAME="exams"></A>
<B>Exams</B>
<P>There will be two 50-minute in-class exams (See the <a href="#schedule">Class Schedule</a> 
below for the dates of these exams.)  Because of
the hierarchical nature of computer science as a discipline --- with each
new concept building on the carefully constructed logical edifice of
all that has come before it --- the exams for this course will
necessarily be cumulative. You may expect, however, that all exams for
this course will emphasize the course material most recently covered.
<p>

Additionally, there will be two 2 hour lab exams, in which you will be asked
to write a Java program on the computer. (See the <a href="#labs">Lab Schedule</a> 
below for the dates of these exams.)

<p>
Except in truly exceptional circumstances, discussed with your
instructor <I>prior</I> to missing an exam, neither in-class nor
lab exams will be rescheduled.

<A NAME="keys"></A>
<B>The Key To Success</B>
<P>
The single most important thing that you can do to succeed in this course
is to do a little bit of work each night.  Do not wait to start a homework assignment
until the night before it is due!
The <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/bulletin/policies.html">Dickinson
College Bulletin</a> states "Credit for courses is based on the assumption 
that at least three hours of study accompany each class period."  That means
that if you wait until the night before the week's homework is due, you could 
quite reasonably have 9 to 12 hours of work to do.  A much better approach,
as stated above, is to do a little bit of work each night.
<p>
The assignments for this course are structured in a way that is designed to
help you do a little bit of work each night.  There is an individual web
page for each class day.  This page contains the reading assignment for that
day, several practice exercises related to the material covered in class and
in the reading and also the assigned homework questions.  A good strategy is
to do the reading and attempt the practice exercises during the evening 
following the class period.  (Okay, you can do them on Saturday instead of on
Friday night!)  Then attempt the homework questions the following evening.  
<p>
Doing a little work each night using the strategy just described has several
benefits. First, doing the reading and practice exercises right away means
that the material from class is fresh in your mind. It also means that if you
still find something confusing after both the class and the reading, or if you
find the practice exercises difficult, you will have time to consult with a
TA or with your professor before attempting the homework questions the next
night.  Talking with a TA or with your professor for 10 or 15 minutes could
save you hours of struggling with a problem that has you stumped.  Thus,
by working a little bit each night you will usually complete the work for
this course in much less time and with much less frustration than by
attempting to do the work all on the night before it is due.  You will
also learn the material more thoroughly as you go, thus reducing the amount
of time that you will need to spend studying for the exams.


<hr>
<A NAME="availability"></A>
<B>Lab Availability</B>

<P> In the Tome building, Rooms 118, 120, 122, 231 and 232 are Mac OS X
labs that are configured with the necessary software for COMP 131.  These labs
are available whenever the Tome building is open, except when scheduled for
classes.  Room 118 is staffed with a TA who should be able to help
you with COMP 131 material from 7:00PM -- 11:00PM Sunday through Thursday,
and also 3:00PM -- 5:00PM on Sundays.

<hr>
<A NAME="integrity"></A>
<B>Academic Integrity</B>

<P>Please take the time to read Dickinson's policy on cheating and
plagiarism contained in the <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/student/code.html">
Community Standards</a> document. Violations of this policy are considered serious transgressions, so you
should be especially certain that you understand your rights and
responsibilities under it.  Students suspected of academic dishonesty
will be subject to the process outlined in the pamphlet; those found
guilty will be subject to disciplinary action and earn a failing grade
in the course. If you are unsure about whether or not certain kinds of
collaboration are permissible, ask your instructor.

<p>
<b>Homework Collaboration Policy</b>
<P>Any homework you submit for evaluation must be your own. This means that
any work you submit for evaluation must have been developed by you and
must have been written by you. Although you should feel free to discuss 
strategies and approaches to assigned work with your instructor, the
TAs, and/or your classmates, you must always write up your solutions
<I>alone</I>. 

<P>To avoid inadvertently cheating --- or even the <I>appearance</I> of
cheating --- you should not write anything down when you are discussing
individual work with other students. If you have truly understood the
ideas discussed, then you should have no difficulty reconstructing
them, incorporating them into your solution, and writing up that
solution, all on your own. 

<P>When completing homework for this course, under no circumstances should you
show another student any program code that belongs to you or have in your
possession code that belongs to another student.

<P>If you consult classmates or other sources besides your instructor
in completing any work for this course, then you are obligated to
acknowledge your debt to these sources <I>in writing</I> as part of
your problem solutions. Please be as specific as possible when
acknowledging a source. You might say, for example, "I talked with X
when working on Problem 3" or "I incorporated Y's idea about Z in my
solution to Problem 5." Proper acknowledgment will not negatively
affect your grade, although failure to provide it may.
<!--
 No other student should
ever look at your computer screen, or at a printout or an electronic
copy of any program of yours, or at any code written by you by hand. In
particular, all help writing and debugging individual programs must
come from your instructor or a TA. 
-->

<p>
<b>Lab Collaboration Policy</b>
<p>You should feel free to incorporate
into your solutions code that appears in the labs or on
the course web site, provided you indicate that the code is not your 
own and where you got it from. You may incorporate <I>no</I> other code
into your solutions. In particular, neither code 
written by students who have previously taken the course,
code from other texts or other
instructors, code from friends or relatives, nor code downloaded from
the Internet may be incorporated into your solutions. 
<p>
Your instructor will specify a policy regarding collaboration with your
classmates on lab assignments.

<A NAME="disab"></A>
<B>Accommodations for Disabilities</B>
<p>
In compliance with the Dickinson College policy and equal access laws,
I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be
recommended for students with disabilities. Requests for academic 
accommodations are to be made during the first three weeks of the semester
(except for unusual circumstances) so that appropriate arrangements can be
made.
<p>
Students are required to register with 
<a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/departments/advising/academicresourceservices.html">
Academic Resource Services</a> in the 
Advising Office located on the first floor of Biddle House
to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.
