<h4><FONT COLOR="0000aa">Class 1</FONT></h4>

<P>Before we start the course, please complete the following survey
that will help me to improve the targeting of the course in future:
<a href="https://dickinson.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0HABwIcfqc9h5wF">computational
theory pedagogy survey</a>.

<P>The textbook is called <i>What Can Be Computed?</i>, which we
    abbreviate as <i>WCBC</i>.   A free electronic copy of WCBC and all of the sample
    programs are available on Moodle.

<P>It is recommended, but not required, that you also purchase a
printed copy of WCBC. The cost is $11. To order your printed copy, you
must give $11 to me or to Tonya Miller in the department office
by <i>5PM Thursday, January 26</i>.  Please pay by cash or check to
"Dickinson College".
      
<P>Today we will go through the syllabus and an overview of the course,
corresponding to WCBC Chapter 1.

<P>If there's time, we will try to run and edit some Python programs
  using IDLE. Key points:
<ul>
  <li>Always use Version 3.x of Python for this course
  <li>You can download Python 3 and install it on your own laptop etc.
  <li>Python is also available on all department iMacs in Tome:
    <ul>
      <li>use the search functionality (top right of the desktop) to
      open IDLE with Version 3.x of Python
      <li>see the <a href="IDLE-screenshot.png">accompanying screenshot</a> if desired
      <li>you can ignore any warnings about the version of Tcl/Tk
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="0000aa">Class 2</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: Chapters 1 and 2 of WCBC.

<P>Warm-up: use containsGAGA.py to determine whether the
file <a href="CAGT.txt">CAGT.txt</a> contains the string "GAGA".

<h4><FONT COLOR="0000aa">Class 3</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 3.

<P><a href="class3-handout.pdf">class3-handout.pdf</a>

<h4><FONT COLOR="0000aa">Class 4</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 4.


<h4><FONT COLOR="0000aa">Class 5</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 5.

<P>To download JFLAP, follow the instructions
at <a href="http://jflap.org/">jflap.org</a> (you will be asked to
fill out a short form). The best version for this course
is <tt>JFLAP_Thin.jar</tt> from May 2011.
  
<P>Minilab (ungraded): using JFLAP,
<ul>
  <li>experiment with <a href="binary-incrementer.jff">binary-incrementer.jff</a>
  <li>Create and test the basic version of LastTtoA (fig 5.3)
  <li>Create and test the abbreviated version of LastTtoA (fig 5.6)
  <li>Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings,
  changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c"
  <li>Optional extras: Create a machine that accepts any string of
  length 10 or more that also contains an "a".
</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="0000aa">Class 6</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 6.


<P>Minilab (ungraded, but important and fun):

  <UL>

    <LI>Download the
<A
    HREF="tu.jff">Universal
    Turing machine</A>
 of Lucas and Jarvis (see also their <A
    HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg0.html">explanatory
    webpage</A> if you're interested).</LI>


    <LI>Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the
      previous class, but using only the alphabet a,b (and blanks).
      If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of
      <a href="LastBtoA.jff">LastBtoA</a>.  We will use LastBtoA as an
      input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      <LI>Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas
      and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      An <A HREF="example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf">explanation
      of the encoding</A> is provided.  Lucas and Jarvis
      provide <A HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html">another
      explanation</A> on their website.</LI>

    <LI>Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an
    appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test
    is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple
    inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Optionally, you can gain familiarity with pumping lemma proofs by
playing a game within JFLAP.  Choose "regular pumping lemma" from the
initial JFLAP window. Then choose "computer goes first" (the "you go
first" option is also interesting and useful, but we don't explain it
further here). Choose one of the languages. Now your job is to force
the computer to violate the pumping lemma. JFLAP's notation is as
follows: <i>m</i> is the pumping cutoff; <i>w</i> is the string in the
language that will have some substring pumped; <i>i</i> is the number
of times <i>w</i> will have a substring pumped; <i>w</i> gets
partitioned as <i>w=XYZ</i> where <i>Y</i> is the substring to be
pumped.
