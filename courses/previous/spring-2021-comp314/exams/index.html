    <H1>Exams</H1>

<P>The midterm and final exams are open note and open web.  Students
may consult any printed or digital materials and may perform web
searches.  Students are encouraged to use all appropriate tools,
including JFLAP, IDLE, Python programs, and existing content on
programming websites and forums. However, it is not permitted to seek
help from other humans either directly or via an online forum.
    
<P>Technically speaking, any material covered in any lecture, reading,
or homework assignment is eligible to appear in the midterm or final
exams. In practice, most exam questions will be similar to a homework
question, an example done in class, or other assigned practice
  questions.
  
<P>Ample extended time will be available to all students and
  the <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20027/academics/4045/ads_test_related_guidance">ADS
  Test-Related Guidance</a> will be followed. <P>Students with
  academic accommodations receive extra time in the normal way. For
  example, if the stated time to submit the exam is 24 hours, a
  student who normally receives time-and-a-half for tests will have 36
  hours to complete the exam.


<P>Exams will be provided in <s>Microsoft Word</s> PDF format. Answers can be
provided in any reasonable format, including Microsoft Word, PDF, or
handwritten solutions that have been scanned/photographed.


<P>Notes:
  <ol>
    <li>When proving results in exams for this course, you may assume,
        without proof, any facts that were stated or proved in class
        or in the textbook (unless the question specifically states
        otherwise).  For example, if it was stated or proved in class
        that a certain computational problem is undecidable, NP-hard,
        or NP-complete, you may use this fact in your proofs.
        However, you must clearly state any fact that you use in this
        way.
    <li>When describing Turing machines and finite automata, you may
        use any generally-accepted notation, including the textbook's
        notation or JFLAP notation.
  </ol>

<h3>Exam 1</h3>

Exam 1 covers material from textbook chapters 1-9 inclusive.  It is
likely to contain questions asking you to:
<ul>
  <li>prove the uncomputability of a problem via the three reduction
  techniques (reduction recipe, explicit Python programs, Rice's
  theorem);
  <li>design or explain Turing machines and/or finite automata that
    accept a certain language or perform a given computation;
  <li>use the pumping lemma to prove non-regularity of a language;
  <li>convert an nfa to a dfa.
</ul>
Of course, it might not include all of the above types of questions,
and there will be other questions too.

The exam begins at the start of class on the designated day of the
exam (10:30 a.m., Thursday March 11, 2021). The exam will be of a length that
could typically be completed in a 75-minute class session. However,
all students will have 24 hours to complete and submit the exam to
Moodle. Therefore, the deadline for submission is 10:30 a.m. Eastern time
on 3/12/21. Late submissions will be penalized by 5% per hour.

<P>The exam can be downloaded from Moodle via a link that will become active five minutes before the start of the exam.

<P>Exam solutions should be submitted to the Exam 1 submission link on Moodle.

<P>All communication with the instructor should be via Microsoft Teams, either via private chat message or by posting to the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a06e1ea5c741c4a09a38e0fc6a7f4e590%40thread.tacv2/Exams?groupId=23da2637-da35-4bf3-9faf-764d41df8a6e&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb">Exams channel</a>, which will be visible to all members of the class. Any announcements or clarifications by the instructor will be posted to the Exams channel.



<h3>Exam 2</h3>

Exam 2 covers material from textbook chapters 10-14 inclusive.  Likely
questions include: estimating the complexity of a Python program;
proving that various problems are in Poly, PolyCheck/NPoly,
NPComplete, NPHard, Expo, etc.; proving there is a polynomial time
reduction from one problem to another; giving examples of problems
that are in or out of the common complexity classes.

<P>The exam begins at the start of class on the designated day of the
exam (10:30 a.m., Tuesday April 27, 2021). The exam will be of a length that
could typically be completed in a 75-minute class session. However,
all students will have 24 hours to complete and submit the exam to
Moodle. Therefore, the deadline for submission is 10:30 a.m. Eastern time
on 4/28/21. Late submissions will be penalized by 5% per hour.

<P>The exam can be downloaded from Moodle via a link that will become active five minutes before the start of the exam.

<P>Exam solutions should be submitted to the Exam 2 submission link on Moodle.

<P>All communication with the instructor should be via Microsoft Teams, either via private chat message or by posting to the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a06e1ea5c741c4a09a38e0fc6a7f4e590%40thread.tacv2/Exams?groupId=23da2637-da35-4bf3-9faf-764d41df8a6e&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb">Exams channel</a>, which will be visible to all members of the class. Any announcements or clarifications by the instructor will be posted to the Exams channel.


<h3>Final Exam</h3>

The final exam is cumulative, covering all topics in chapters 1-14
with approximately equal emphasis.  The style and content of questions
on chapters 1-14 will be similar to the two midterm exams.

<P>Chapters 15-17 will be examined too, but the style of questions will
be less rigorous: you are expected to have read and understood this
material, but detailed calculations and proofs based on chapters 15-17
are not required. The ungraded questions in Assignment J are typical
examples of questions that could be asked about chapters 15-17.

<P>The exam begins at the start of the designated exam slot for this
course (2:00 p.m., Thursday May 13, 2021). The exam will be of a
length that could typically be completed in 120 minutes. However, all
students will have 48 hours to complete and submit the exam to
Moodle. Therefore, the deadline for submission is 2:00 p.m. Eastern
time on 5/15/21. Late submissions will be penalized by 5% per hour.

<P>The exam can be downloaded from Moodle via a link that will become active five minutes before the start of the exam.

<P>Exam solutions should be submitted to the Final Exam submission link on Moodle.

<P>All communication with the instructor should be via Microsoft Teams, either via private chat message or by posting to the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a06e1ea5c741c4a09a38e0fc6a7f4e590%40thread.tacv2/Exams?groupId=23da2637-da35-4bf3-9faf-764d41df8a6e&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb">Exams channel</a>, which will be visible to all members of the class.
