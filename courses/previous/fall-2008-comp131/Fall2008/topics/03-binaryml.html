System</a>
<DD>As the authors themselves put it "A pretty damn clear guide to a quite confusing concept by Christine R. Wright with some help from Samuel A. Rebelsky."  The section on 'Basic Concepts Behind the Binary System and 'Conversion from Decimal to Binary' is
most relevant to what we did today in class.

<DT><a href = "javascript:openIt('http://dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/micromachine.html', 'KS')">The Knob &amp; Switch Computer with Control Unit</a>
<dd>The this version of the Knob &amp; Switch Computer adds a Control Unit allows for up to 5 instructions to be entered using the 1's and 0's of machine language. The patterns of 1's and 0's in the machine language instructions correspond to the knob and switch settings in the CPU . You can experiment with this extended simulator by entering machine language instructions directly, or it is also possible generate the instructions automatically by setting the knobs and switches then clicking on the green arrow next to an instruction. You can play with this version of the Knob &amp; and Switch simulator until you have a better feel for how machine language instructions can control the operation of the computer's CPU and memory.

<li> For the Knob &amp; Switch Computer with Control Unit:
   <OL type = "a">
<LI> What machine language instruction specifies  moving the contents of Main Memory cell 7 into Register R0?

<LI>Give the machine language instruction that subtracts the contents of 
 Register R1 from 
 the contents of Register R0 and stores the
 result in  Main Memory Cell 4.  In pseudocode:

<LI>Using 1 bit it is possible to write down 2 different patterns of 1's and 0's (e.g. 0 and 1).  Using 2 bits, how many different patterns of 1's and 0's can you write down?  What are they?  Using 3 bits what are the patterns you can write down? <I>Hint: each of the patterns using 2 bits can have a third bit added to
them and the third bit can be either a 1 or a 0.</I>
   </ol>
<li> For the Knob &amp; Switch Computer with Control Unit:
   <OL type = "a">

<LI>List a sequence of machine language instructions (a machine language 
program) for adding the contents of
Main Memory cells 1 and 2 and storing the result in Main memory cell 3.  In pseudocode:
<XMP>
    MM[3] = MM[1] + MM[2]
</XMP>

<LI> Write a machine language program that stores 4 times the number in 
 Main Memory cell 1 into Main Memory cell 2.  (Hint: it is easy to double
 the value of a number stored in a register.)
