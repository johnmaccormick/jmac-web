<h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
<p>
Use the <i>StudentDatabase-v1</i>
project to complete each of the following exercises:
<ol>
<li> Add a <code>changeInstructor</code> method to the <code>Student</code>
    class.  This method takes
    the department and number of the class and the name of the new instructor
    as parameters, and changes the instructor of the class.  If the student is
    not taking the specified class, the method should print an error message
    Be sure to include a javadoc comment for your method.
 <p>
    Hint: you should not have to write a loop to implement this method!
<li> Write test cases for the <code>changeInstructor</code> method that
    properly test it (statement coverage is a minimum goal).
                                                                                
<li> Add the following two methods to the <code>Student</code> class:
   <ul>
   <li> a method called <code>isTakingFrom</code> that takes the name of an
      instructor as a parameter and returns boolean - true if the student is
      taking a course from that instructor, and false otherwise.
   <li> a method called <code>dropCourseOf</code> that takes the name of
      an instructor as a parameter, and drops one course from the  
      student's schedule that the specified instructor is teaching.
    </ul>
                                                                                
     These methods should not contain any repeated functionality.
    Be sure to include javadoc comments for these methods.
                                                                                
<li> Write test cases for the <code>isTakingFrom</code> and 
 <code>dropCourseOf</code> methods that properly test these methods.

</ol>

<h3>Homework Assignment 10a</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Download and unpack the 
<a href="../examples/LibraryDB.zip"><i>LibraryDB</i></a> project and use it to
 complete the following exercises.
<ol>
<li> Study the interface view for the <code>Book</code> class, as you will
 need to use instances and methods of this class in completing the following
 exercises.  The implementation of the <code>Book</code> class and test cases
 achieve statement coverage have been provided for you.  (There is nothing
 to turn in for this exercise.)
<li> Complete the definitions of the constructor and the
 <code>getLibraryName</code>, <code>getNumBooks</code>, <code>addBook</code>
  and <code>getBook</code> methods of the <code>Library</code> class.
<li> Create a test class for the <code>Library</code> class, and write a
  test case for the constructor.
<li> Write test cases for the <code>addBook</code> and <code>getBook</code>
  methods that properly test those methods.  In particular, you should
 test that <code>getBook</code> behaves correctly when returning a book
 at the beginning, middle and end of the collection, and also when the
 library does not have a book with the specified call number.
<li> Write test cases for the <code>hasBookByAuthor</code> and 
 <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code> methods (that have been provided for you)
 that properly test those methods.  Statement coverage is a minimum goal.
 In particular, you should test that these methods behave correctly when 
 a book by the specified author is at the beginning, middle and end of
 the collection, and when the library has no books by the specified author.
<li> The <code>hasBookByAuthor</code> and <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code> 
 methods contain repeated functionality for finding the position of a <code>Book</code>
 by a particular author.
 To eliminate this repetition, refactor the methods as follows:
  <ul>
  <li> add a new method that gets the position of a <code>Book</code> by
    a particular author (specified as a parameter), or indicates that no
    <code>Book</code> by this author was found in the library.
  <li> use your new method to refactor the <code>hasBookByAuthor</code> and 
   <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code> methods so that they 
    no longer contain any loops
  </ul>
 Make sure that your test cases still pass after this
 refactoring.
</ol>

Save this project.  You will be adding to it in the next three assignments and
then submitting it via Web-CAT.
