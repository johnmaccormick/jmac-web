  and complete the implementation of the 
 <code>CellPhoneAccount</code>

 provides a general description of the class, and each method and
 constructor has a detailed comment.
 You must declare the fields and implement
 the constructor and all of the methods for the class.
 You must also create a test class and write test cases that achieve
 statement coverage for the constructor and all of the methods that you
 have defined.
