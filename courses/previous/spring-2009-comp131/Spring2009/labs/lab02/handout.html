<P>
Use the <a
href="javascript:openIt('http://users.dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/machine.html','KSM')">Knob
&amp; Switch Computer with Assembler</A>  to answer the following questions.
Middle click to see the
<a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/instructions.html">
assembly language instruction set</A> in another window.
Hand in a print out of your answers at the start of the next lab period.
If the answer to a question is an assembly language program, please list the
memory location that the instruction is stored in before each instruction
(as in the examples below).
<OL>
<LI>Consider the following contents of Main Memory:
<XMP>
    0:  LOAD R0 5
    1:  LOAD R1 6
    2:  SUB R2 R1 R0
    3:  STORE 7 R2
    4:  HALT
    5:  10
    6:  5
    7:  0
</XMP>
What is the result of executing this stored program (i.e. what values are
placed into which memory locations)?
<br><br>
<LI>Consider the following contents of Main Memory:
<XMP>
    0:  LOAD R0 7
    1:  LOAD R1 8
    2:  ADD R2 R1 R0
    3:  LOAD R3 9
    4:  SUB R0 R3 R2
    5:  STORE 10 R0
    6:  HALT
    7:  3
    8:  5
    9:  10
   10:  0
</XMP>
What is the result of executing this stored program with the given values?<BR><BR>
Try replacing the contents of memory locations 7, 8, and 9 with other
values.  Based on your experiments, if we associate the variable name
<I>a</I> with location 7, the name <I>b</I> with location 8, the name
<I>c</I> with location 9, and the name <I>d</I> with location 10, what
value are we computing?  (Your answer should be an equation using the
variables <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>List a sequence of assembly language instructions (an assembly language
 program) for subtracting the content of Main Memory cell 9 from the content
 of Main Memory cell 8 and storing the result in Main Memory cell 10.
 In pseudocode:
<XMP>
    MM[10] = MM[8] - MM[9]
</XMP>

<LI> Write an assembly language program to sum the numbers in locations
 13, 14, and 15, and store the result in location 16.
 In pseudocode:
<XMP>
    MM[16] = MM[13] + MM[14] + MM[15]
</XMP>

<LI> Write an assembly language program to find the larger of the numbers
 stored in locations 13 and 14, and put that number into location 15.
<br>
<br>

<LI> Write an assembly language program to store the absolute value of
 MM[12] + MM[13] into MM[14].  
<br>
<br>

<LI> Bonus Question: 
 Write an assembly language program to compute the sum of all of the numbers
 between 1 and the number stored in MM[30], and store the result in MM[31].
 For example, if the value 5 is stored in memory location 30 then your program
 would store 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) in memory location 31.
 You may assume that the value 1 is stored in MM[29] and that the value in 
 MM[30] is greater than 0.  NOTE: You will have to manually enter values into
 MM[29] and MM[30].
