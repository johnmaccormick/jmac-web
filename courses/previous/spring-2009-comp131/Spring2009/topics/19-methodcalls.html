<H3>Practice Exercises</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Add accessor methods for the checking and savings account balances
 of the customer to the <code>BankCustomer</code> class.  These methods should simply return the balance of the appropriate account.
<LI> Create test methods for the accessor methods that you added in the previous exercise.  Use a test fixture for your test cases.
<li> Add a method to the <code>BankCustomer</code> class to transfer money 
 from the customer's checking account to the customer's savings account.
 Your method must print an error message if sufficient funds are not
 available for the transfer, and not change any account balances
 in this case.
<li> Write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the transfer
 method that you wrote in the previous exercise.  Use the test fixture that you created earlier for your test cases.
<!--
<li>  Do Exercises 3.28 and 3.30 - 3.32 in Barnes &amp; Kolling.
 For Exercise 3.30, start by implementing the version that works internally
 as a 24 hour clock.  If you can answer the questions in the exercise
 without finishing the implementation, then you do NOT need to complete the 
 version that stores hours from 1 to 12 only.

<H3>Homework Assignment 6c</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Using the <i>Bicycle</i> project that you started working on in
  the previous homework assignment:
<ol type="a">
 <li> complete the definitions of the remaining methods in the class
 <li> write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the
  <code>setFrontTireSize</code>, <code>setRearTireSize</code>,
  <code>getSeatSize</code> and <code>getSeatColor</code>  methods
 <li> submit your <i>Bicycle</i> project via WebCAT
</ol>

<li> Modify the <code>withdrawChecking</code> method of the 
 <code>BankCustomer</code> so that it has overdraft protection as specified
 in the following:
 <ul>
 <li> if the checking account has sufficient funds for the withdrawal,
      then the checking balance should be updated as usual
 <li> if the checking account does not have sufficient funds for the
  withdrawal, but the combination of the checking and savings accounts
  is sufficient, then all funds should be withdrawn from the checking
  account and the remainder of the funds needed to cover the withdrawal
  should be withdrawn from the savings account
 <li> if the combination of the checking and savings accounts does not
  contain sufficient funds for the withdrawal, then an error message should
  be printed and no balances should be modified
 </ul>
  Copy and paste your modified <code>withdrawChecking</code> method 
 as your answer to this exercise.

<li> Write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the method
 you defined in the previous exercise.  Your test cases MUST use a 
 test fixture containing at least 3 objects.  Copy and paste the test methods 
 and the <code>setUp</code> method from the test class as your answer for 
 this exercise.  (The <code>setUp</code> method contains the code used
 to create the test fixture.)
