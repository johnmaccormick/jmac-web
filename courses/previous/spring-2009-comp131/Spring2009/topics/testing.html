<h3>General Testing Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li> always give a test method a descriptive name that starts with the
 word "test"
<li> always record test cases for each constructor or method immediately
 after writing it
<!--
<li> for methods that contain if statements:
  <ul>
  <li> make sure that you have statement coverage (all statements are 
       executed by your tests)
  <li> write a separate test method for each possible behavior (different
       section of code that could be executed)
  </ul>
-->
</ul>

<h3>Testing Constructors and Accessors</h3>
<ol>
<li> use one test method for each constructor
<li> create an object using the constructor
<li> call an accessor method to check the value of each field
</ol>
<p>
Note that you do not need to create a separate test method for each
accessor.

<h3>Testing Mutators</h3>
<ol>
<li> use at least one test method for each mutator
<li> create an object using a constructor
<li> call the mutator
<li> call an accessor method to check the value of the field that was
     changed
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Contain <code>if</code> statements</h3>
<ol>
<li> write sufficient tests to achieve statement coverage
<li> use a different test method for each different segment of code
     that can be executed when the method is called. <p>
  Examples:
  <ul>
  <li> the following method:
<pre>
public int spindle(int x) {
    if (x < 3) {
        return x + 1;
    } else {
        return x + 2;
    }
}
</pre>
 requires at least two test methods: one for <code>x < 3</code> and one
 for <code>x >= 3</code>
  <li> the following method:
<pre>
public int mutilate(int x, int y) {
    if (x < 3) {
        if (y > 4) {
            return y;
        } else {
            return x + 2;
        }
    } else if (y < 3) {
        return y + 1;
    } else {
        return x - y;
    }
}
</pre>
 requires at least four test methods:
 <ul>
 <li> one for <code>x < 3 && y > 4</code>
 <li> one for <code>x < 3 && y <= 4</code>
 <li> one for <code>x >= 3 && y < 3</code>
 <li> one for <code>x >= 3 && y >= 3</code>
 </ul>
  
  </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Only Print</h3>
For methods that only print to the terminal window (no return value
or change of field values):
<ol>
<li> call the method
<li> manually inspect the output in the terminal window
</ol>
It is a good idea to clear the terminal window before running your tests
when you have this kind of test cases.

<h3>Testing Constructors that Create a Collection</h3>
<ol>
<li> create a test method for the constructor (see the rule for Constructors above)
<li> in that test method, check the size of the new collection to 
ensure that the <code>ArrayList</code> or the Array was created 
correctly by the constructor.
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Add to a Collection</h3>
<ol>
<li> add several elements to the collection
<li> check the size of the collection
<li> get the first element of the collection, and check enough fields
     to be sure it is the one you expect
<li> get the last element of the collection, and check enough fields
     to be sure it is the one you expect

<p>
Note that you must also have a method that gets an element from the 
collection (by index).
</ol>


<h3>Testing Methods that Get an Element from a Collection by Index</h3>
<ol>
<li> create a test method to test getting an element at a negative index
<li> create another test method to test getting an element at an index that
     is too large
</ol>
Note that it is not necessary to test getting from
a valid index if you already tested adding elements to a
collection as described above.

<h3>Testing Methods that Remove an Element from a Collection by Index</h3>
<ol>
<li> add several elements to the collection
<li> remove an element from the middle of the collection
<li> check the size of the collection
<li> check the element that is now at the index you removed from
     (check enough fields to be sure it is the one you expect)
<li> in separate test methods:
  <ol type = "a">
  <li> test removing an element at a negative index
  <li> test removing an element at an index that is too large
  <li> in these cases, just check that the size of the collection was not
       changed
  </ol>
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Modify Elements of a Collection</h3>
<ol>
<li> modify the elements (call the method)
<li> check at least one modified element
<li> check at least one unmodified element (if any)
<li> in each case, check the field(s) that could have been modified
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Compute An Aggregate Result over a Collection</h3>
This rule applies to methods that find the average of some field of
the collection's elements, count the number of elements of the collection
that satisfy some property, ...
<ol>
<li> in one test method, add several elements to the collection, then
 call the "aggregate" method and check that the result is correct
<li> in another test method, use an empty collection to call the 
 "aggregate" method and check that the result is correct
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Search a Collection</h3>
<ol>
<li> use one test method to test searching an empty collection
<li> use another test method to test searching a collection that does not
     contain the searched-for object
<li> use a third test method to test searching a collection that does
     contain the searched-for object
</ol>

<h3>Testing Methods that Return Collections</h3>
<ol>
<li> use one test method to check that the empty collection is 
     returned correctly
<li> in another test method, check that a non-empty collection is returned
     correctly:
  <ol type = "a">
  <li> check the size of the collection
  <li> check the first and last elements (check enough fields to be sure they
       are the ones you expect)
  </ol>
</ol>
