<h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
<p>
    Use the <i>StudentDatabase-v1</i></a>
    project to complete the following exercises:
<ol>
<li> Refactor the method that you added to the <code>RegistrarsOffice</code>
    class to count and
    display the number of students who are eligible to graduate with each
    level of latin honors (from the last class meeting)
    by declaring and using a constant for the minimum GPA required for each
    level of latin honors.
    These constants should be declared in the <code>Student</code> class.

<li> Suppose that the only departments in the college are
    MATH, COSCI, ENGL, PE and MISC.
    Declare a constant in the <code>Course</code> class to represent each of
    these possible departments.
<li> Modify the constructor for the <code>Course</code> class so that the
    department is
    set to MISC if the parameter for the department is not one of  MATH,
    COSCI, ENGL, or PE.  Use the constants that you defined in
    the previous exercise.  Update the javadoc for the constructor
    appropriately, and add a test case that verifies this new behavior.
<li> Add a method to the <code>Student</code> class to count and
    display, for each of the possible departments, the number of classes
    that the student is taking in that department.
    For example, the ouput from this method
    might be:
                                                                                
<pre>
MATH: 2
COSCI: 1
ENGL: 0
PE: 0
MISC: 1
</pre>
                                                                                
    Use the constants that you have defined for the departments.
 <p>
  Be sure to include a javadoc comment for your method, and to write
 test cases as needed.

    <li> Refactor the <code>Student</code> class as follows:
    change the <code>schedule</code> field from an 
    <code>ArrayList</code> to a <code>HashMap</code>, and update all methods of 
    the <code>Student</code> class except for <code>toString</code> and 
    <code>print</code> to work correctly with the this change.
    Use the combination of the course department and number as the key for the
    <code>HashMap</code>, and the <code>Course</code> object as the value.
    The department and number can be combined via string concatenation (+).
    For example, if department contains the <code>String</code> "MATH" and
    number contains 161, then <code>department + number</code> evaluates to
    the <code>String</code> "MATH161".
    Run the tests to verify that the program still works correctly (except
    for the <code>toString</code> method).
</ol>

<h3>Homework Assignment 10c</h3>
<p>
Complete the following exercises using
the <i>LibraryDB</i>
project that you have been working on for the last two homeworks.
<ol>
<li> Declare a constant of type <code>int</code> called
 <code>OLD_BOOK_YEAR</code> with a value of 1900 in the
 <code>Book</code> class.  Then write a method in the <code>Book</code>
 class called <code>isOld</code> that returns true if the publication
 year of the book is earlier than 1900, and false otherwise.  Use the
 constant in your method definition.  Include a javadoc comment for your
 method, and write test cases that achieve statement coverage.
 <p>
 Remember that you must use exactly the specified method name, parameters
 (none) and return type (<code>boolean</code>), or Web-CAT will be unable
 to grade your code.
<li> Suppose that the library only has books with the subjects:
 Math, Computer Science, History and Fly Fishing.  Declare a constant in
 the <code>Book</code> class for each of these possible subjects.
<li> Modify the constructor of the <code>Book</code> class so that it uses
 the constants that you defined for the previous exercise.  Specifically, a new <code>Book</code> must be assigned one of the four permitted subjects.  If the constructor parameter specifying the subject is not one of the permitted ones, assign the book to your favorite of the four permitted subjects. Make sure that
 your test cases still pass.
<li> Add a method called <code>countBooksBySubject</code> to the
    <code>Library</code> class to count and
    display, for each of the possible subjects, the number of books on
    that subject that the library has.  For example, the ouput from this method
    might be:
                                                                                
<pre>
Number of books by subject area:
Math: 5
Computer Science: 3
History: 6
Fly Fishing: 897
</pre>
                                                                                
 Use the constants that you have defined for the subjects.
 Be sure to include a javadoc comment for your method, and to write
 test cases as needed.

   <li>  Perform the following refactoring:
    change the <code>books</code> field of the <code>Library</code> class
    from an 
    <code>ArrayList</code> to a <code>HashMap</code>, and update the 
    constructor and the <code>addBook</code>, <code>getBook</code>,
    <code>checkOutBook</code> and <code>returnBook</code> methods of 
    the <code>Library</code> class to work correctly with the this change.
    Use the call number as the key for the
    <code>HashMap</code>, and the <code>Book</code> object as the value.
    For the moment, you should comment out the remaining methods
    of the <code>Library</code> class (<code>hasBookByAuthor</code>,
    <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code>, <code>print</code>, 
    <code>countBooksBySubject</code>, and the method that
    you added when refactoring <code>hasBookByAuthor</code> and
    <code>deleteBookByAuthor</code>) so that it will compile.
<p>
    NOTE: for any method definition that you need to change, do NOT delete
    the previous version of the method body.  Instead, simply comment it out
    using <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> comments so that it will be
    ignored by the compiler, and then put the new version of the method below
    the old version.  Failure to comply with these instructions will result in
    an immediate 15 point deduction.
<p>
  Save your <i>LibraryDB</i> project - you will be submitting it via
 Web-CAT after completing the next homework assignment.
