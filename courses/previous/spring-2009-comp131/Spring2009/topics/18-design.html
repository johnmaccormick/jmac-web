<HR>
<H3>Practice Exercises</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Draw an object diagram for instances of the <code>BankCustomer</code>
 and <code>Account</code> classes representing yourself and your bank
 accounts.  (Please do NOT use your actual bank account numbers and balances.)
<li> Open the <i>MyComputer</i> project that you completed as a homework exercise
in <a href="10-printing.html">Class #10</a>, create a new class <code>ComputerOwner</code> within 
 that project, and implement the <code>ComputerOwner</code> class as follows:
 <ol type = "a">
 <li> Declare fields so that an instance of class <code>ComputerOwner</code> 
 can hold the following information for a computer owner: name, address, 
 telephone number and a reference to a <code>Computer</code> object representing
 the computer that the person owns.
 <li> Define a constructor that initializes all fields of a 
 <code>ComputerOwner</code> using parameters.
 <li> Define accessor methods for the name, address and telephone number.
 <li> Create a test class for <code>ComputerOwner</code>, and write a
 test method for the constructor.  Your test method should not check the
 value of the <code>Computer</code> object associated with a
 <code>ComputerOwner</code>.
 </ol>
<li> Do Exercises 3.1, 3.4, and 3.22 - 3.25 in Barnes &amp; Kolling.
Many of these exercises use the <i>clock-display</i> project from Chapter 3.
</ol>

<HR>
<H3>Homework Assignment 6b</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Download and unpack the <a href = "../examples/Bicycle.zip">
 <i>Bicycle</i></a> project, open it in BlueJ, and use it to complete
  the following steps.
  <ol type="a">
  <li> complete the definitions of the <code>BicycleSeat</code>
 and <code>Tire</code> classes according to the specifications given
 in those classes
  <li> create test classes for the <code>BicycleSeat</code>
 and <code>Tire</code> classes, and write test cases that achieve statement
 coverage for those classes
  <li> (partially) complete the definition of the <code>Bicycle</code>
 class according to the specifications given in that class.  Note that
 you should NOT complete all of the methods for this homework assignment -
 you should stop at the comment that says: 
<pre>
// STOP HERE FOR CLASS #18 HOMEWORK
</pre>
  <li> create a test class for the <code>Bicycle</code> class, and write
 a test case that checks that the constructor sets the manufacturer and
 number of gears correctly for a <code>Bicycle</code> object.  You do not
 need to check the values of any other fields set by the constructor.
  <li> you will be submitting your <i>Bicycle</i> project via
  WebCAT as part of a future homework assignment, so there is nothing
  to submit for this exercise (yet).
 </ol>

<li> Using the <i>Bicycle</i> project that you worked on in the previous
   exercise:
<ol type = "a">
<li> Draw a class diagram for the classes in this project.
<li> Draw an object diagram for an instance of the <code>Bicycle</code>
     class.  Use any values for the fields that are of the appropriate type
     and that could reasonably represent a real bicycle.
</ol>
<li> Do Exercise 3.2 in Barnes &amp; Kolling.
<li> Do Exercise 3.3 in Barnes &amp; Kolling.

</ol>
