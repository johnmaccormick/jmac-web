    <H1>Programming assignment 2</H1>

To turn in this assignment, please submit a single zip file of your
Java file(s) to Moodle.

    <DL>
      <DT>Question 0.1</DT>
      <DD>Download the <A
      HREF="JavaAnalyzer.java">JavaAnalyzer code</A> provided for this
      assignment.  Try to read and understand the code as much as
      possible before moving on. </DD>

      <DT>Question 0.2</DT>
      <DD>Read and understand the first few screens of <A
      HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/regex/index.html">Sun's
      java tutorial on regular expressions</A>. At a minimum, you
      need to compile and run the test harness they provide, and
      understand the sections on string literals, predefined
      character classes, and boundary matchers.  (Thanks to Russell
      Toris, who provided a <A HREF="RegexTestHarness.java">new
      version of the test harness</A> that
      compiles on the Macs in Tome.) You also need to
      understand the use of the backslash character as an escape
      character in java regular expressions.  Specifically, if you
      don't understand the use of double backslashes in the code
      <TT>Pattern.compile(console.readLine("\\s\\w*\\s")</TT>, or
      the actual meaning of this regular expression, please seek
      help from the instructor or a classmate.


      <DT>Question 1. (80 points.)</DT>
      <DD>As stated in the JavaDoc for the JavaAnalyzer class, a typical output is:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
fields:<br>
line 14:        private String label;<br>
<br>
constructors:<br>
line 27:        public DfaVertex(String label)<br>
<br>
methods:<br>
line 43:        public void addTransition(String symbol, String dest)<br>
line 57:        public String getTransition(String symbol)<br>
line 64:        public String getLabel()<br>
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
		    (This output was produced by using the input file <TT>DfaVertex.java</TT>
 from programming assignment 1.)  <P>

Let us agree to call a field, constructor, or method <I>ordinary</I>
if it is declared using the simplest possible set of keywords: an
access modifier, a datatype or return type if required, a name, and
a parameter list if required.  Specifically, ordinary fields and
methods do not have additional keywords such as <TT>static</TT> or <TT>final</TT>.
Additionally, ordinary declarations don't have any comments or other
tricky syntax.  For this question, you need only find matches for
the ordinary declarations.

Thus, the task for this question is to add code to the JavaAnalyzer
class that will print out all the ordinary declarations in a manner
similar to the output given above.  You must use regular expressions
to find the appropriate lines.  To assist with grading, please do
not alter any existing code, and only add code in places marked by
the string "PROGASSIGNMENT2".  </DD>

      <DT>Question 2. (20 points.)</DT>
      <DD>Improve your code from question 1 to cope with
      declarations that are not ordinary.  Try to cover as many
      cases as you can think of.  One obvious thing to account for is
      the optional use of keywords such as <TT>static</TT> and
      <TT>final</TT>.  Also,
      consider what might happen if a literal string or a
      single-line comment contained a string that looked exactly like
      a declaration.  You may assume
      that multi-line comments (i.e. <TT>/* ... */</TT>) 
      are not present, and
      that declarations do not span multiple lines.</DD>

      <DT>Extra credit. (20 points.)</DT>
      <DD>(If you attempt the extra credit, please submit the
      attempt as a separate file.)  Alter the code so that it works
      correctly even when multi-line comments are present, and when
      declarations span multiple lines.  Your general approach
      should still use regular expressions, but don't worry too much
      about efficiency or memory limitations.  In particular, it's
      fine to slurp the entire input file into memory before
      starting your processing. (This would be a very bad way to
      write a compiler, but we are not concerned about that
      here.) It's fine to edit the existing code for this part of
      the assignment.</DD>
