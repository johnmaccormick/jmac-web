    <H1>Programming assignment 1</H1>

To turn in this assignment, please submit a single zip file of your
Java files to Moodle.

    <DL>
      <DT>Question 0.</DT>
      <DD>Download the <A
      HREF="prog-asst-1.zip">dfa code</A> provided for this
      assignment.  Read the JavaDoc first.  Then read the code
      itself.  Make a note of anything you don't understand, but
      don't spend too much time on minor details.  </DD> 

      <DT>Question 1. (80 points.)</DT>
      <DD>Complete the code of the <TT>accepts()</TT> method in the
      <TT>Dfa</TT> class.</DD>

      <DT>Question 2. (20 points.)</DT>
      <DD>Alter the code so that transitions can be labeled with
      multiple symbols, as introduced in Linz, Example 2.2.  In
      other words, lines such as <TT>Q1 acd Q3</TT>
      should now be permitted in dfa files. (The intended meaning of
      this line is that the dfa transitions from <TT>Q1</TT> to
      <TT>Q3</TT> on
      encountering <TT>a</TT> or <TT>c</TT> or <TT>d</TT>.)  </DD>

      <DT>Extra credit. (20 points.)</DT>
      <DD>(If you attempt any extra credit problems, please make a
      new copy of your Java files and submit them separately, so
      that your attempt on the previous questions can be graded.)
      (i) Alter the code so that it works for nfas. (ii) Write code
      that converts an nfa to an equivalent dfa. (iii) Read Linz,
      Section 2.4, then implement an algorithm that minimizes the
      number of states in a dfa.</DD>
