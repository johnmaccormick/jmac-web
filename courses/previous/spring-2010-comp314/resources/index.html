    <H1>Detailed schedule and class resources</H1>


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: Tuesday, January 26</FONT></h4>

Strongly recommended, but not required, background reading: the
draft of a book chapter entitled "What is computable?", available on
Moodle.

Brief introduction to what we will be studying and why.  Very brief
discussion of the syllabus.

Lecture on the existence of impossible programs: we'll see why it is
impossible to write a computer program that detects all potential
crashes in all other programs.  

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Friday, January 29</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 1.1. 

<P>You can ignore the discussion of "order at most", "order at
least", and "same order of magnitude" on page 6.  In class, we will
concentrate on the definition of a graph, and on revising proof by
induction (previously covered in the discrete math course).  Most of
the other material in this section will be required later, but we
will revisit such material when needed.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 3: Tuesday, February 02</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 1.2.  

<P>Note the definition of "language" given near the bottom of page
18.  The lecture will emphasize two different views of what a
"language" can mean to a computer scientist: 1. a programming
language, and 2. the answer to a mathematical problem (more
specifically, a list of numbers that satisfy some given property,
such as being prime or being even).

<P>Mini-lab to understand basics about grammars:
  <UL>
    <LI>fire up JFLAP.  Click on grammar.  Create your own grammar.  (Use S as the start symbol. Use uppercase letters as variables, lowercase letters as terminal symbols.) </LI>

<LI>Choose "multiple brute force parse".  In the frame on the right, in the input column, enter a string you believe is in the language defined by your grammar.  Click "run inputs" and check that "accept" is the result.  </LI>

<LI>Now click "start" in the top-left frame.  Click "step" a few times.  Switch between inverted tree and derivation table, try to understand what is being shown here.  </LI>

<LI>Step through the derivation of another string that is in your language; this time ensure the string has length at least 4.  </LI>

<LI>Find a string that is not in your language; make sure that the result is "reject".  Find several more strings that get rejected.  </LI>

<LI>Find the three shortest strings that are accepted. Find the three shortest strings that are rejected.</LI>
  </UL>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 4: Friday, February 05</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 2.1.  

<P>The lecture will briefly mention some of the material in Linz
1.3, but this section is not required reading.

<P>This class will include a mini-lab using JFLAP to investigate
some rudimentary dfas.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 5: Tuesday, February 09</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 2.2.  

<P>JFLAP mini-lab to investigate
non-determinism.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6: Friday, February 12</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 2.3.  

<P>JFLAP mini-labs to practice converting
between nfa and dfa.  JFLAP files for Linz examples are available:
<A HREF="fig2.12.jff">fig2.12.jff</A>, <A
HREF="fig2.14.jff">fig2.14.jff</A>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 7: Tuesday, February 16</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 3.1.

<P><A HREF="grep-minilab.pdf">grep minilab</A>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 8: Friday, February 19</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 3.2.

<P>If time permits, continue with the same <A
HREF="grep-minilab.pdf">grep minilab</A> as last time.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 9: Tuesday, February 23</FONT></h4>



Required reading: Linz 3.3.

<P>A <A HREF="regular-languages-summary.pdf">summary of converting between different descriptions of regular languages</A> is provided.

<P>Minilab suggestion: JFLAP provides interactive demos of almost
every conversion in the summary mentioned above.  We have covered
some of them in previous minilabs. Explore as many of the other
conversions as possible, both in the lecture today and in your own
time.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 10: Friday, February 26</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 4.1.

<P>Minilab: Start working on question 0.2 of programming assignment
2.  Run the example code as given, and experiment with
metacharacters such as \s, \w, \S, \W, \b. Now change the code so
that the regular expression is hardwired as a literal string in the
code itself.  Again experiment with a range of metacharacters.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 11: Tuesday, March 02</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 4.2.

<P>No minilab.  Instead, we work on examples demonstrating more
interesting closure properties.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 12: Friday, March 05</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 4.3.

<P>Here is a <A HREF="example4-6-proof.pdf">proof of Linz example
4.6</A> (p114) that resembles the pumping lemma more closely than
the proof given in the book.  It is strongly recommended you master
this proof (you should be able to write out the second, abbreviated
version).


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 13: Tuesday, March 09</FONT></h4>

No new required reading, but this would be a great time to reread
Linz 4.3.

<P>Check out the cool math in today's <A
HREF="pumping-lemma-handout.pdf">pumping lemma handout</A>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 14: Friday, March 12</FONT></h4>

In-class exam --- no required reading.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 15: Tuesday, March 23</FONT></h4>

Required reading: reread Linz 4.3.

<P>minilab: Try out a few of the pumping lemma examples on JFLAP.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 16: Friday, March 26</FONT></h4>

Important note: for the remainder of the course, required reading
does not include the proofs of theorems unless specifically stated.

Required reading: Linz 5.1, 5.2. Section 5.3 is optional but
interesting, and therefore recommended.  Also, you can skip the
following topics from Section 5.2, which will not be covered in this
course: s-grammar (definition 5.4 and example 5.9); inherently
ambiguous grammars (definition 5.6 and example 5.13)


<P>Note that there will be some changes based on the <A
HREF="mid-semester-feedback-results.pdf">midsemester feedback</A>.

<P>minilab: Explore brute force parsing in JFLAP: 1. run JFLAP's
brute force parser on the grammar S->aA|AbS,A->a|SA, with w=abaa --
ensure you understand the result. 2. create a grammar, and a string
that you are sure is in the grammar, such that JFLAP needs more than
20 seconds to find it using brute force parse. 3. same as (2), but
your grammar may have only two rules. 4. same as (3), but make the
string as short as possible.  5. plot time as function of string
length.  Explain.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 17: Tuesday, March 30</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 6.1 and 6.2.  Skip Greibach Normal Form
(pages 167-169).

<P>minilab: practice each type of grammar transformation in JFLAP. Here are some simple grammars on which to try each type of transformation:
  <A HREF="useless1.jff">useless1.jff</A>,
  <A HREF="useless2.jff">useless2.jff</A>,
  <A HREF="lambda.jff">lambda.jff</A>,
  <A HREF="unit.jff">unit.jff</A>,
  <A HREF="chomsky.jff">chomsky.jff</A>,
  <A HREF="grammar-to-reduce.jff">combine everything</A>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 18: Friday, April 02</FONT></h4>

Required reading: Linz 8.2.

<P>minilab: 1. (skipped from last time) Implement an npda for a^n
b^n in JFLAP.  2. implement an npda for the language generated by
the grammar S->aSbbb|aab (Hint: Try to write out a description of
the language in set notation first.) 3.  work on the skipped minilab
from class 16.

  class. What is the main practical difference between these two
  solutions? </LI>
