    <h2>Design Patterns Lab</h2>


The objective of this lab is to understand some of the fundamentals of
an important software technique known as <i>design patterns</i>.  The
content of the lab is authored by Professor Wahls, and we will be
using the description he provided for a previous instance of the
Senior Seminar, available from the following link:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~wahlst/491/lectures/lec15.html">Professor
  Wahls' design pattern lab</a>
</ul>

<P>There are a few minor differences between Professor Wahls' description, and the way the lab will operate in our own class.  The differences are:
<ul>
  <li>You must work in the randomly-chosen pairs announced in class.
  <li>To submit your work, please submit to Moodle a single ZIP file
  of the .java files in the <tt>cardealership</tt> folder.
  <li>You are not required to document your code in this lab. The code
  will be graded on correctness and elegance of design only.
  <li>A small amount of extra credit is available for a written answer to the following question:
    <ul>
      <li>The visitor pattern, as described in this lab, applies to
      any set of classes, including classes that are not related by
      inheritance. If, on the other hand, the set of classes we may
      wish to visit all inherit from a common superclass or interface
      to which we can make changes, the visitor pattern can be
      simplified somewhat. Write a few paragraphs describing how you
      can simplify the pattern in this case, including some example
      code to clarify your explanation if necessary.  (Hint: fewer
      code changes are required, and you will need to use
      Java's <tt>instanceof</tt> keyword.)
    </ul>
    If you attempt this extra credit question, put your written answer
    in a separate file (.txt, .pdf, .docx, or any other easily
    readable format) and submit it to Moodle in the same ZIP file as
    your code.  Do not submit an altered version of your code.
</ul>
