<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 13: April 23</FONT></h4>

<P>In this class, we discuss two classic papers, both of which are available on Moodle.  The papers are:
<ol>
  <li>Dijkstra, Edsger W., [Letter to the editor] Go to statement
  considered harmful. Communications of the ACM, Volume 11, Issue 3,
  March 1968, pages 147-148.
  <li>R. Karp, Reducibility among combinatorial problems, in R. Miller and
  J. Thatcher (eds), Complexity of Computer Computations, Plenum
  Press, 1972, pp85-104.
</ol>
You are required to read all of the Dijkstra, but only sections 1 and
4 of the Karp (and within section 4, don't read the whole proof of the
main theorem: instead, pick just one of the <s>21</s> 20 reductions in the
proof, and be prepared to explain that one reduction to the rest of
the class).
