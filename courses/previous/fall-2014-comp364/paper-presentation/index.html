    <H2>COMP364 Research paper presentation</H2>

The research paper presentation will summarize a state-of-the-art
research paper in the field of artificial intelligence.  Each team of
students will pick a different paper from the conference AAAI 2014,
read the paper and any necessary background literature, and present a
summary of the paper.  The list of papers to choose from is available
in the
online <A HREF="http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai14contents.php">AAAI
proceedings</A>. (Note: You must choose a paper from one of the "Main
Track" sections. In other words, the paper must appear before page
2880 in the proceedings.)

<P>In choosing a paper, note that you are not necessarily required to
understand all the mathematical details of the paper. In your final
presentation, you must be able to clearly explain:
  <UL>
    <LI>What is the problem the authors are trying to solve?
    <LI>What is the basic idea behind the authors' solution to this problem?
    <LI>How well does the idea work in practice?
  </UL>

<p>There are two milestones related to the presentation, labelled PP0
and PP1. These milestones are described below.



  <H3>PP0 (ungraded)</H3>


<P>Notify the instructor and the class of the paper you have chosen.
  Notification is by posting a reply to the "PP0: choice of paper for
  presentation" forum on Moodle.  Papers are selected on a first-come
  first-served basis; you can't choose a paper that has already been
  chosen by someone else.  In your Moodle post, please give the title
  of the paper and the names of both students who will be presenting
  it.

<!-- <H3>PP1 (due Thursday, October 14, 3pm; worth 5 points)</H3> -->

<!-- Submit a 1-2 page document that includes: -->
<!--     <UL> -->
<!--       <LI>a high-level summary of your chosen paper (around 0.5-1 pages)</LI> -->
<!--       <LI>a brief description of your strategy for -->
<!--       presenting the paper, including what will be the -->
<!--       important main points, and what will be left -->
<!--       out.</LI> -->
<!--       <LI>a list of background reading that will be -->
<!--       completed (a minimum of one other research paper -->
<!--       is suggested, most likely selected from the -->
<!--       references in your chosen paper)</LI> -->
<!--     </UL> -->

 <H3>PP1</H3>


The PP1 milestone is the presentation itself. A
    detailed <A HREF="presentation-rubric.pdf">rubric</A> for grading
    of the presentation is provided.  You may use any combination of
    data projector slides, whiteboard, and speaking; use whichever
    combination of media is most effective for delivering your
    message.  The most important points to observe are:
  <UL>
    <LI>Presentations are limited to 12 minutes, plus 3
    minutes for questions.</LI>
    <LI>The objective of the presentation is to communicate the main
    interesting idea of the paper to your classmates.  You will need
    to present sufficient background or explanatory information for
    your classmates to understand the research, without wasting time
    on unnecessary details.  As already stated above, the presentation
    must explain the main problem addressed by the paper, explain the
    basic idea behind the solution, and report on the effectiveness of
    the solution.</LI>
  </UL>
