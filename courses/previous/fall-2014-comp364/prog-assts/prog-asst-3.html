<H2>Programming assignment 3</H2>

<P>In this assignment, you will complete the implementation an AI for the game of Clue.  The implementation uses propositional logic and theorem proving. The main resources you will need are:
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Background information and explanation of code framework:</B>
    This document, available here as <A
    HREF="clue.pdf">clue.pdf</A>, is written by Todd Neller, Zdravko
    Markov, and Ingrid Russell.  You will need to read and
    understand the whole document, but for our purposes, the only
    graded portions of the assignment are the implementation
    exercises in Section 8.
    <LI><B>Code framework:</B> The <A HREF="pa3-framework.zip">code
    framework</A> is also written by Todd Neller, Zdravko Markov,
    and Ingrid Russell.
    <LI><B>The theorem prover zChaff:</B> zChaff is a theorem prover
    developed by the Boolean Satisfiability Research Group at
    Princeton University.  For further details, check out the <A
    HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html">zChaff
    website</A>.  For this assignment, however, all you need is the
    zChaff program itself. Download either the <A
    HREF="mac/zChaff.zip">Mac version of
    zChaff</A>, or the <A HREF="windows/zChaff.zip">Windows version of
    zChaff</A> as appropriate. Extract the contents of the
    downloaded zip file, and copy
    the file "zChaff" into the directory containing your Java .class files
    for this assignment. (By default, Eclipse puts these files in a
    directory called <TT>bin</TT>, so that is where you should put
    the zChaff
    executable.)  Note: The Windows version of zChaff is provided
    for
    convenience, but I can't devote resources to supporting it. If
    in doubt, please use the Macs in the lab.

  </UL>

Some other important points include:
<UL>
  <LI>You may find that you are unable to run your program from within Eclipse, due to the need for running the separate executable zChaff from within the Java program. However, running from the command line should work fine.
    <LI><B>Practice!</B> It will be much easier
    to implement your Clue player if you have experience at playing
    the game.  Please take advantage of the Clue set in the majors'
    room.  A game requires a minimum of three and a maximum of six
    players.
</UL>

To turn in this assignment, submit the single file
<TT>ClueReasoner.java</TT> to Moodle.  Grading will be based on the
standard criteria for grading code in this course, as listed on the
main assignments page.
