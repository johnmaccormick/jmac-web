    <H2>COMP364 Exams</H2>

<P>As stated on the syllabus: "Exams are open note: any printed or
written material may be consulted during an exam. Electronic devices
may be used only to consult the following: (i) e-books; (ii) resources
on the class website. Electronic devices may not be used for any other
purpose, unless stated otherwise in the exam. In particular, you may
not write or compile any source code on an electronic device, and you
may not perform web searches.  A majority of exam questions will be
similar to the sample exam questions provided on the course webpages."

<P>Therefore, the best way to prepare for an exam is to ensure that
you can effortlessly answer the sample exam questions.  Note that
solutions to all sample questions are provided on Moodle.

<P>Exams will be 75 minutes in length.
