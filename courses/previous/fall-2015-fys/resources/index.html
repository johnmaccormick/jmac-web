<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Thursday, August 27 at 10:15am</FONT></h4>

<P>Introductions. Scheduling of course selection meetings for Friday if
necessary. Discussion of syllabus and expectations.  Then walk to
Rubendall Hall in Weiss for a plenary session at 10:45 AM.

<P>Notes:
<ol>
  <li>Please bring <i>Writing Analytically</i> to every class.
  <li>For every class that has a required reading, you must bring to
class some written or typed notes about the reading. Sometimes, this
webpage will provide study questions to guide you in creating these
notes. If no study questions are provided, you must still bring some
notes about a few things you consider interesting, unusual or notable
in the reading.
  <li>Many of the study questions used in these resources incorporate
the suggestions of other Dickinson professors. They are acknowledged
by their initials: [CS] for Prof. Claire Seiler; [MS] for
Prof. Melinda Schlitt; [TP] for Prof. Ted Pulcini;
    <!-- [BW] for Prof. Blake Wilson; --> [HC] for Humanities
    Collective as a group.
</ol>
  

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Saturday, August 29 at 10:15am</FONT></h4>

<P>Preparation:
  <ul>
    <li>Read books 1, 6 and 9 of the Iliad.
      <li>Be prepared (with written or typed notes) to answer the following
	questions:
	<ol>
	  <li>(Book 1) Is Achilles a hero or a spoiled brat? [MS]
	  <li>(Book 6) Why does Hector fight?  [MS]
	  <li>(Book 9) Why does Achilles not fight?  [MS]
	  <li>(All books) Note at least two different similes or
metaphors, and explain what they might tell us about the Homeric
world.  [CS]
	    </ol>
  </ul>

<P>In class, we will try to apply "The Method" (Writing Analytically,
  pp26-27) to Achilles' big speech in book 9 (lines 312-441):
<ul>
  <li>As a fun initial investigation (<b>not</b> a substitute for
reading the text carefully and noticing repetitions with your own
brain!), create a word cloud of the speech.  Use a web search to find
out how to create a word cloud. The of the speech is available
as <a href="achilles-book9-speech.txt">achilles-book9-speech.txt</a>. (Note:
This text is from Cowper's 1849 translation, obtained from
Gutenberg.org -- it's out of copyright so we are free to download and
use it. Of course this translation is extremely different to the
    Lombardo we are using in class.)
    <li>Now apply The Method: 1. repetitions; 2. strands; 3. binary
    oppositions; 4. choose and amplify; 5. anomalies.
    </ul>
  
<P>Nice <a href="achilles-book9-speech-word-clouds.pdf">word clouds</a>, everyone!

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, August 31</FONT></h4>

<P>Preparation:
  <ul>
    <li>As always, do the required reading and bring written or typed
  notes of a few things you consider interesting, unusual or notable.
  If you want more detailed directions on this, use the "Notice and
  Focus" methodology described on pp24-25 of <i>Writing
  Analytically</i>.
    <li>Try to make a drawing of the Shield of Achilles as Hephaestus
forges it in Book 18, lines 515-652. Bring your sketch to class. [CS]
    <li>Read over assignment A1---we will discuss any questions about
the assignment in class.
      </ul>

<P>Optional: check out the incredible variability
in <a href="comparison-of-Iliad-translations.pdf">translations of the
Iliad</a>.

<P>Here's a selection of <a href="shields-of-achilles.pdf">our own
interpretations of the Shield of Achilles</a>.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, September 4</FONT></h4>

<P>Preparation: Study questions for the reading:
  <ol>
    <li>What method for determining the truth of historical events does Thucydides claim he is employing? [HC]
    <li>What explains the origins of the war, according to Thucydides? [HC]
    <li>Why are the Spartans doomed to suffer defeat, according to Pericles? [HC]
  </ol>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, September 7</FONT></h4>

<P>Preparation: Study questions for the reading:

    <li>What effect did the plague of Athens have on the moral
    character and public spirit of the people of Athens? [HC]
    <li>What is Cleon's main complaint against the Athenian assembly? [HC]
    <li>Compare the section on the "Civil War in Corcyra" (starting on
    p. 89) to the section on the plague in Athens (starting
    p. 46). Note the similarities and differences. [HC]
  </ol>

<P>Remember, this class is a plenary session in Stern.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, September 11</FONT></h4>

<P>Preparation: Bring written or typed notes detailing several
strange/revealing/interesting aspects of the reading. Your notes must
include elements from both book 2 and book 4 of Plato.

<P>Don't forget that you need to complete
the <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/info/20391/library/2583/the_library_and_first-year_seminars/5">academic
integrity tutorial</a> by September 21. It would be a good idea to get
it done this week.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, September 14</FONT></h4>

<P>Preparation: Study questions for the reading (all courtesy of [HC]):
  <ol>
    <li>(Book VIII) Having established the most ideal constitution in
    Book IV (the kingship or aristocracy), what are the remaining four
    constitutions described here? What are their counterparts in the
    soul of the individual? How are they related to each other, and
    the "parts of the soul" established in Book IV (rational,
    spirited, appetive...)?
    <li>(Book VIII) Which passages rang true for you? With which
      ones did you strongly disagree? (choose a couple of each)
    <li>(Book X) What is "imitation" as it is presented here? How is
    this relevant to his discussion of poetry, and what does this
    latter discussion add to his previous treatment of poetry?
    <li>(Book X) How and where does the topic of justice/injustice re-enter the discussion?
    <li>(Book X) Near the end of this final book of the Republic is an
    account of the Myth of Er: why is it there?
  </ol>

<P>Groups for peer review and discussion with Writing Associate Taylor Hunkins:
  <ul>
    <li>Group 1: Brendan, Max, Alex, Andy
    <li>Group 2: Michaela, Chris, Connor, Paul
    <li>Group 3: Jenn, Amanda, Nate, John
    <li>Group 4: Josh, Sarah, Penelope
  </ul>
Each group needs to select one of the following times to meet with
Taylor: Wednesday 7:30-8:30, Wednesday 8:30-9:30, Thursday 3:00-4:00,
Thursday 4:00-5:00, Thursday 7:30-8:30, Thursday 7:30-8:30, Friday
3:00-4:00, Saturday 12:00-1:00, any time after 3pm Saturday, Sunday
  anytime between 2-9, Monday 7:30-8:30, Monday 8:30-9:30.

First come, first served -- your group should select its slot by
writing on the whiteboard at the front of the classroom.
  
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, September 18</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Read St. Augustine's <i>City of God</i> Books 14 and 19,
except that in book 19 you can omit Chapters 1-4 and Chapter 23.  The
relevant excerpts are available on Moodle. Then prepare  responses to the following:
<ol>
  <li>Book 14: Apply the "notice and focus" methodology from Writing
  Analytically (p24) to Book 14.  Note that this goes beyond what we
  have done in previous classes. You need to not only find
  interesting/strange/revealing aspects, but rank them in order of
    importance and state why they are interesting/strange/revealing.
  <li>Book 19: Augustine suggests that even though we cannot have
  happiness in this life, it doesn't follow we should kill ourselves
  or turn away from the world. But when we do participate in the
  functions of the world, problems still make themselves felt. How
  does Augustine use the duties of a judge to contribute to his
  argument there can be no true happiness on earth (444-445)? [TP]
  <li>Book 19: What's the difference between the kind of peace pursued
  by the heavenly and by the earthly city, and to what extent do they
  work together to achieve their separate ends (464)? [TP]
    </ol>

<P>Some useful information for our discussions:
  <ul>
    <li>Top 20 words in Book 14: man, god, flesh, sin, good, soul, according, should, lust, body, love, evil, live, fear, himself, men, our, nature, desire, other
    <li>Top 20 words in Book 19: god, peace, life, man, good, men, own, other, body, may, soul, virtue, such, our, nature, true, supreme, city, people, should
  </ul>

<P>Slides from the <a href="A1-discussion.pdf">discussion on
assignment A1 feedback/improvement</a> are available.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, September 21</FONT></h4>

Plenary session in Rubendall. Don't forget to take notes, since your
participation will be graded during our next class meeting, by asking
for examples of specific details of what you learned.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, September 25</FONT></h4>

Preparation:
<ul>
  <li>The required reading is the Foreword and Cantos 1-13 of
the Inferno.  Our class discussion will focus on Cantos 1-6, so Cantos
7-13 can be skimmed fairly lightly.
  <li>My suggestion for how to read Dante:
    <ul>
      <li>Before you read each Canto, read a plot summary of what is
      going to happen in that Canto. The
      main <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)">Wikipedia
	  article on the Inferno</a> is perfectly fine for this.
      <li>Read the Canto carefully.
      <li>Go
      to <a href="http://danteworlds.laits.utexas.edu/index2.html">Dante
      worlds</a>, and read some of the background information about
	the characters and imagery in the Canto.
      <li>Make some notes about what was interesting or revealing in that Canto.
	</ul>
  <li>Optionally, check out another excellent
    resource: <a href="http://www.worldofdante.org">World of Dante</a>.
  <li>The specific discussion questions/activities for class are:
    <ol>
      <li>Choose one scene in Canto 5 or 6. Draw a sketch of the
      scene, labeling the main elements and clearly stating what lines
      in the text describe your scene. The sketch does not need to be
      elaborate -- don't spend more than about 10 minutes on it. But
      also, try to do it completely from your own imagination and
      reading of the text. Do not search online for ideas and
      especially not for images.
      <li>What's the rhyme scheme of the Italian orginal? What's the
      rhyme scheme of the English translation? Is there any
      difference? (Don't look online for the answers. Figure it out
	for yourself.)
      <li>How many lines are there in the Italian version of Cantos 1,
      2, and 3 respectively? How about the English translation?  Note
      that lines occur in groups of three called <i>tercets</i>. How
      many tercets are there in each of the first three Cantos?
      (Calculate it for both Italian original and English
      translation.)
      <li>So far you have read Homer/epic poetry, Thucydides/history,
      Plato/philosophy, and Augustine/theology. To which of these does
      Dante seem closest, and in what way(s)? (there may be more than
      one answer to this). [MS]
      <li>How real a voyage does Dante wish us to believe this is?
      What are the "realistic" elements, and what purpose do you think
      they serve? [MS]
    </ol>
</ul>  

<P>Please sign up for an additional library session using
the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_tGwo-9_1B1cq1ue-NEIiftvCQIKBdXyeFGbiXmGCT8/edit?usp=sharing">online
sign-up sheet</a>. Attendance at an additional library session will
form part of your participation grade for the course.

<P>Thanks for the interesting sketches from Canto 5 and 6. Here are a
couple of the <a href="cerberi.pdf">impressions of Cerberus</a> (Canto
6).
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, September 28</FONT></h4>

This class will be our library session led by Malinda Triller Doran,
Dickinson's Special Collections Librarian.  The class will take place
in the Alden room of the library.

<P>Preparation: before class, you are required to complete the
following online tutorials (each of them takes only 5 to 10 minutes),
available from
the <a href="http://libguides.dickinson.edu/tutorials">library's
tutorials page</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>"Finding Books in the Waidner-Spahr Library" (all 3 modules)
    <li>"Distinguishing Among Source Types"
  </ul>
So that I can include your completion of these tutorials in the
participation grade, please also complete the very
brief <a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=621018">library
tutorial assignment</a> on our own Moodle page.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, October 2</FONT></h4>

Preparation:
<ul>
  <li>The required reading is Cantos 14-24 of
the Inferno.  Our class discussion will focus on Cantos 14-19, so Cantos
    20-24 can be skimmed fairly lightly.
  <li>No study questions are provided for today. Instead, make a
    note of at least one interesting/strange/revealing thing in each
    of Cantos 14-19.
  <li>One more resource you may find helpful: on Moodle there is a
  canto-by-canto summary, broken down by line numbers, of the main
  events in the <i>Inferno</i>. It's taken from Robert Hollander's
  edition of the <i>Inferno</i> and the filename is "Hollander
  Summaries - Inferno.pdf".
</ul>

<P>In class, we will spend some time on the exercise on page 234
of <i>Writing Analytically</i>, "Try This 11.2: Qualifying Overstated
Claims".  There's no need to prepare in advance for this.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, October 5</FONT></h4>

Plenary session in Stern. As usual, take notes so that your
participation can be graded on Friday.  Also do the required reading,
focusing on the last six cantos: Cantos 29-34.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, October 9</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Focus your reading on Act I of <i>The Tempest</i>, and
prepare answers to the following study questions:
<ol>
  <li>Find Prospero's reference to the "liberal arts". What are the
  similarities and differences between Prospero's idea of liberal
  arts, and our own idea of the liberal arts at Dickinson (which is,
  after all, a liberal arts college)?
  <li>Find a word that is used at least three times in Act I. (Do not
  choose a common word like "the" or an obviously uninteresting word
  like "Prospero".) Note the line numbers of the three occurrences and
  write out the meanings of these lines in plain English.  What is the
  significance of the word that you found? How does it connect to the
  themes of <i>The Tempest</i>?
</ol>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, October 12</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Focus your reading on Acts IV and V of <i>The
Tempest</i>, and on the two short essays of required reading listed on
the syllabus: Montaigne, from <i>Of the Cannibals</i>, pp.119-120;
William Strachey, from <i>True Repertory of the Wrack</i>,
pp.121-23. (These page numbers are in our edition of
the <i>Tempest</i>).  Prepare answers to the following study
questions:
<ol>
  <li>Consider Prospero's famous "revels" speech (IV.i.146-163).  Does
  this speech lead to the two cities of Augustine?  Are there any
  other connections to readings from earlier in the semester? [MS]
  <li>Think about the workings of justice in the play.  How would
  different characters define it?  Does justice rule in the end?
    Whose justice? [MS]
  <li>In one or two sentences of your own words, summarize the
significance of the Montaigne and Strachey essays as they relate
to <i>The Tempest</i>.
</ol>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, October 16</FONT></h4>

You are invited to lunch at my house during our normal class time
(1130am-1245pm).  Feel free to arrive any time between 11:30 and
12:00.  The address is 260 Mooreland Ave., just a few minutes' walk
from campus.  There is no reading or other preparation required (and

look forward to seeing you there!

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, October 19</FONT></h4>

No class -- fall pause.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, October 23</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Read only the following excerpts from
Descartes' <i>Discourse on Method</i>: Parts 1-2 (pp. 1-13), Part 4
(pp. 18-22), and selections from Part 5 (pp. 23-26 and 31-33 only).
Prepare answers to the following study questions:
<ol>
  <li>Why is Descartes "delighted most of all in mathematics" (p4)?
  <li>What is the "first principle of philosophy" developed on page 18? [MS]
  <li>According to Descartes (pages 31-33), what distinguishes men
  from "beasts"? [MS]
  <li>Use Banner to print out a copy of your "degree audit". Print out and bring a <b>hard copy</b> of your degree audit to class.  Turning in your degree audit will form part of today's participation grade. 
</ol>

<P>Please take the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zBQXEwbMp6VxhSg6KLt9vf9jTNHwjdpvQCDf3VlsLDs/viewform?usp=send_form">class survey</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, October 26</FONT></h4>

Plenary session in Stern.  There is no required reading but there is a homework exercise on Moodle, which will contribute to your participation grade.  The exercise asks you to list 4-6 courses that you plan to take next semester, with brief reasons.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, October 30</FONT></h4>

Preparation: 
<ol>
  <li>Do the four required readings, as described in the syllabus.
  Off-line versions of the documents are available on Moodle. Online
  links are provided here for convenience, all courtesy
  of <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/">The Founders'
  Constitution</a>:
    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIXs3.html">Samuel
Adams, The Rights of the Colonists, 20 Nov. 1772</a> (Note that you
are only required to read certain excerpts of this speech.  The Moodle
version contains only the excerpts you are required to read, whereas
the link provided here contains the whole speech.)
  <li><a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch1s5.html">Declaration of Independence</a>
  <li><a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s23.html">1789
letter from Jefferson to Madison</a>
  <li><a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch10s16.html">James
Madison, Federalist, no. 51</a>
    </ul>
  <li>As usual, make notes on the readings, including at least one
  interesting/strange/revealing item about each of the four readings.
  <li>Also bring to class your notes on Monday's plenary session, for
  use in some brief participation grading.
</ol>


<P><a href="response-summary.pdf">Class survey results</a> are
available.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, November 2</FONT></h4>

<P>The required readings are as stated in the syllabus, but our class
discussion will focus on the following two components:
<ul>
  <li>Excerpts from Adam Smith's <a href="Adam_Smith.pdf">Wealth of Nations</a>. 
  <li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf">The
  Communist Manifesto</a>, by Marx and Engels.  Our discussion will
  focus on Parts I and II (pages 14-27 of the PDF linked here).
</ul>

<P>Preparation: Make notes on the excerpts described above, and
prepare answers to the following study questions:
<ol>
  <li>How does Smith's discussion of human nature and the differences
  among people (end of Book One, chapter II) fit with Plato's? (The
  relevant <a href="plato-specialization.pdf">Plato extract on
  specialization</a> is available.)  Are people naturally "fit" for
  some task or another? [MS]
  <li>Does Smith really want no regulation at all? Indeed, what sort
  of regulation is necessary for even Smith's vision to be realized?
  Would Smith agree that "Greed is Good"? [MS]
  <li>If Marx were alive today, how do you think he would define
  "bourgeois" and "proletarian" within US society?  Give some specific
  examples of which US residents would be in each category.
  <li>Consider the list of 10 specific communist policies listed near
  the end of section II of the manifesto.  Of these 10 policies, which
  would be considered "communist" today? Which would be considered
  "socialist"? Which would be considered reasonable by a majority of
  US congressional representatives?
</ol>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, November 6</FONT></h4>

<P>The required readings are as stated in the syllabus, but our class
discussion will focus on the following excerpts:
<ul>
  <li>Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i>: the first six pages of chapter 3,
  and the first six pages of chapter 4.  (A document containing all of chapters 3 and 4 is available on Moodle.)
  <li>Alan Turing's paper <i>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</i>: sections 1, 2, and 6 only. (A document containing the whole paper is available on Moodle.)
</ul>

<P>Preparation: Make notes on the excerpts described above, and
prepare answers to the following study questions:
<ol>
  <li>Find a quotation in the Darwin excerpt giving Darwin's
  definition of the "Struggle for Existence." Rephrase the definition
  in your own words. How does this differ from the more famous phrase
  "survival of the fittest"?
  <li>How would you compare the style of Darwin's prose to that of
  Descartes? Give at least one similarity and one difference.
  <li>In section 1 of his paper, Turing describes an "imitation game,"
which these days is called the <i>Turing test</i>.  Turing actually describes
two versions of his imitation game. The first version involves three
humans. In this first version of the imitation game: (a) Who are the
players? (b) What are the rules for winning the game?  (c) Who do you
think will win on average?  
    <li>The second version of the imitation game involves two humans
and a computer (note that Turing often uses the word "machine" where
we would use "computer").  This second version is what we commonly
refer to as the Turing test today. What are the rules for winning the
second version? Who do you think would win in a contest where the
computer was played by an existing chat bot such
as <a href="http://www.cleverbot.com/">Cleverbot</a>
or <a href="http://alice.pandorabots.com/">Alice</a>?
    <li>In section 6, Turing rebuts nine possible objections to his belief
that a computer program could, in principle, win the imitation
game. The objections are numbered (1)-(9).  From these nine
objections, choose the one objection that you find most
compelling. (a) Explain why you believe your chosen objection may be
plausible. (b) Which part of Turing's rebuttal to your chosen
objection do you believe may be incorrect?
</ol>

<P><b>Connections between today's readings and the rest of the
course:</b> Below is a useful quotation from a book recommended to me
by Dennis Looney, our plenary speaker on Dante.  The book
is <i>Turing's man: Western culture in the computer age</i> (UNC
Press, 1984) by J. David Bolter.  The excerpt comes from the opening
of his chapter on artificial intelligence.  It neatly summarizes the
view of humanity as conceived by several of the authors we have
studied. Bolter says:
  <blockquote>In classical and Christian thinking, man was a made
thing, the crown of creation, perhaps, but not the creator. Whatever
modern biology has done to stress the continuity of life from microbe
to man, we still think of ourselves as the highest manifestation of
evolution, or the creative power of nature. In fact, our modern
self-appraisal is possibly higher than that of the Platonist or the
Christian theologian. They believed in orders of existence beyond our
own, the Platonist in ideas and the Christian in angels and
God. Dispensing with God as a hypothesis, the modern biologist sees
man, and in particular his brain, as the most highly organized matter
to be found in the natural world. (p189)</blockquote> The possibility
of artificial intelligence (computer programs that are
indistinguishable from humans in certain respects -- as envisaged by
Turing) partially undercuts this final viewpoint, arguably removing
the human brain from its pedestal as "the most highly organized matter
in the natural world."

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, November 9</FONT></h4>

Plenary session in Stern. As usual, take notes and bring them to the
next class for some brief participation grading.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, November 13</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Read Du Bois chapters 1, 3, and 6. Make notes on each of
these three chapters. At a minimum, your notes should include the
following, for each of the three chapters: (a) A 1-2 sentence summary
of the chapter in your own words; (b) One
interesting/strange/revealing item from the chapter.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, November 16</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Two separate forms of preparation are required for this class:
<ol>
  <li>Do the same preparation as for the previous class, except this
time covering chapters 8, 10, and 14 of Du Bois. (That is, for each of
those three chapters, prepare at minimum a 1-2 sentence summary in
    your own words and one interesting/strange/revealing item.)
  <li>Choose your favorite sentence from any one of the nonfiction
    readings we have done this semester, and submit it to the Moodle
    assignment called "favorite sentence."  Be prepared to explain in
    class why you like the sentence.  We will be using these sentences
    as examples to discuss the idea of good writing.
</ol>

Thanks for submitting your favorite sentences. Here they
are: <a href="favorite-sentences.html">favorite-sentences.html</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, November 20</FONT></h4>

Preparation: Try to read the whole Achebe book before next Monday's
plenary.  But for Friday's class, our discussion will be focusing on
chapters 1-3 and 21-25. (That is, pages 1-25 and 178-209.) So, read
these chapters carefully before Friday. If you choose to skip chapters
4-20, read a summary of the plot from somewhere (e.g. the book's
Wikipedia page is fine for this). As you read, refer to
the <a href="https://public.wsu.edu/~brians/anglophone/achebe.html">online
study guide by Paul Brians</a> at Washington State University.  This
study guide lists one or more study questions for each chapter. For
each of the eight chapters in our discussion (i.e. 1-3 and 21-25),
choose <i>one</i> question from the study guide, write down the
question and your answer to it, and bring these notes to class.  So,
you should be bringing to class written or typed answers
to <i>eight</i> questions in total.  In class, each student will have
particular responsibility for presenting a brief plot summary and an
answer to the study question for one chapter, assigned as follows:
Chapter 1 Max and Penelope; Chapter 2 Jen and Amanda; Chapter 3 Andy
and Alex; Chapter 21 Chris and Connor; Chapter 22 Sarah; Chapter 23
Josh; Chapter 24 Nate; Chapter 25 Brendan; Chapter 26 John and
Paul. [Update, 11/20/15, 9:45am: so, Chapter 26 doesn't exist. My
mistake. John and Paul are off the hook!]

<P>Nice coincidence -- it was Achebe's birthday on Monday and he was
featured on a podcast I frequently listen to called <i>The Writer's
Almanac</i>: <a href="http://writersalmanac.org/episodes/20151116/">http://writersalmanac.org/episodes/20151116/</a>. (Click

Plenary session in Stern.

No class -- Thanksgiving.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, November 30</FONT></h4>

Preparation: read the whole Duras book. There are no specific study
questions. So, instead of bringing <i>answers</i> to class, please
bring at least one <i>question</i> about the book.

<P>This <a href="word-cloud-all-readings.png">word cloud</a>, based on
the frequencies of word occurrences in all readings this semester,
might be useful in trying to summarize the major themes of the course.
The word cloud is also available
in <a href="word-cloud-all-readings.zip">zipped svg</a> format, but
you will need to download and unzip it to view. (Acknowledgment: word
cloud generated

For the brave, some more detailed analysis of word frequencies is

This final class is a plenary session in Stern.  (Recall there are no
first-year seminar classes in the week of December 7.) Optional
preparation for this session: I recommend you read chapters 3 and 4 of
Appiah.  Also, our final assignment is due.  

<P>Thanks to everyone for playing Ideas Survivor.

reading that had the greatest impact on you are available.
