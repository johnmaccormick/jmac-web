Programming assignment 1. Q3 = quiz 3. PP2 = paper presentation,
milestone 2. FP1 = final project, milestone 1.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: Monday, August 30</FONT></h4>

Introduction to course and discussion of syllabus.  Elementary
notions of classical search. Discussion of the cannibal problem. <A
HREF="SimpleCannibals.java">SimpleCannibals.java</A> demonstrates
one possible approach -- but note that this code is incomplete (look
at the end of the <TT>findSolution()</TT> method to see where).

<P>Ungraded homework, due by class 3: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Read and understand the <A
HREF="SimpleCannibals.java">SimpleCannibals.java</A> code.</LI>


    <LI>Make a list of all questions you have about this code.  The
    questions need not be related to artificial intelligence -- it
    is crucial that you understand all of the Java used in this
    code, so make a note of any Java features that are not clear to
    you.  We will discuss these questions in class 3.</LI>

    <LI>Complete the two challenges in the code (search for the word
    "challenge" to find them).</LI>
  </UL>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Thursday, September 2</FONT></h4>

Required reading: 
<UL>
  <LI><I>Computing machinery and intelligence</I>,
A. M. Turing, Mind 59(236), October 1950 (Available on Moodle).  You
must bring with you to class either an electronic copy (e.g. on a
laptop) or a printout of the reading.  Be prepared for an
interactive discussion, including answers to the following two
questions: In your opinion, what is the <I>most</I> compelling of
the nine objections listed in Section 6? What is the <I>least</I>
compelling?</LI>
  <LI>1.1, 1.2, 1.4</LI> </UL> 

<P> Class will consist of
  discussion of the readings.  

  <P>Here is a link to a <A

<P> Sample quiz questions: 

  <UL>
    <LI>Do you
  believe the Turing Test is a valid approach for defining whether a machine can think?  Justify your answer in a few sentences.</LI>

    <LI>Select
  two of the objections listed in Turing's 1950 paper on AI. For
  each objection you select, describe the objection itself in one
  sentence, then explain Turing's rebuttal of the objection in
  another sentence or two.</LI>

    disadvantage of the strategy compared to one of the other
    strategies. (See table on Figure 3.21 in the textbook, and my
    solution.)</LI>
