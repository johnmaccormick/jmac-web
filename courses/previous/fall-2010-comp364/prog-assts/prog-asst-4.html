<H2>Programming assignment 4: Decision trees</H2>

<P>In this assignment, you will complete the implementation a
decision tree.  All the resources you need are provided in a single
zip file: <A HREF="pa4-resources.zip">pa4-resources.zip</A>.  

<P>The resources comprise three directories: the Java source files
for a code framework, the Javadoc for the code framework, and some
data for your experiments.  You should first read all the Javadoc,
concentrating especially on <TT>AttributeSet</TT>,
<TT>InstanceSet</TT>, and <TT>Distribution</TT>. (Click on
<TT>index.html</TT> to start reading.)  Don't bother reading all of
the source files; consult these as needed, if and when the Javadoc
proves to be insufficient.

<P>Glance at the data files (each has the extension <TT>.arff</TT>)
using a text editor. A constructor for <TT>InstanceSet</TT>
automatically reads a <TT>.arff</TT> file, so you need not interact
with these files directly, but it will help to have some familiarity
with these files when debugging your code. The file format is fairly
obvious and is not described further here.

<P>The three data files provided are <TT>weather.nominal.arff</TT>,
<TT>contact-lenses.arff</TT>, and <TT>soybeanB.arff</TT>.  The first
file is a fake data set for deciding whether or not to play tennis
based on the current weather conditions, authored by Witten and
Frank and provided with their Weka machine learning software. This
is a small, almost trivial machine learning problem; it's not very
interesting, but an extremely useful file for debugging. The second
file is a real data set for determining what type of contact lenses
to prescribe to a patient based on their condition. The third file
is a real data set for determining what type of disease a soybean
has (although the file has been edited to remove so-called missing
data, which we don't deal with in this assignment).  Both the second
and third files are part of a well-known collection of machine
learning data collated and distributed by the University of
California, Irvine, and known as the UC Irvine Machine Learning
Repository.

<P>To complete the assignment, add and/or alter code at the nine
locations of the string "TODO" in the three source files
<TT>DecisionTree.java</TT>, <TT>DecisionTreeInternal.java</TT>, and
<TT>DecisionTreeLeaf.java</TT>.  When finished, your code should
successfully and correctly generate decision trees for all three
provided data files.  This is accomplished in the <TT>main</TT>
method of DecisionTree, which accepts a single commandline argument:
the name of the <TT>.arff</TT> file to be used.  Do not edit or add
code at any location other than the "TODO" markers.

<P>To turn in this assignment, submit a single ZIP file containing
the three source files <TT>DecisionTree.java</TT>,
<TT>DecisionTreeInternal.java</TT>, <TT>DecisionTreeLeaf.java</TT>
to Moodle.  Grading will be based on the standard criteria for
grading code in this course, as listed on the main assignments page.
