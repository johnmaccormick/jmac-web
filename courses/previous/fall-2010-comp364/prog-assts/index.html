    <H3>Criteria for grading code</H3>

The grade assigned to code will be based mostly on the following criteria:

    <UL>
      <LI>Correctness: does the program produce the correct output
      for all reasonable inputs?</LI>

<LI>Clarity: is it easy for a programmer who is not familiar with
the code to understand how it works?  This includes writing code
that is itself easy to understand, and writing comments that futher
explain aspects of the code.  Public classes, fields, and methods
must have JavaDoc comments, but private fields, methods and some
parts of method bodies may also require comments.  The code
framework distributed with assignment 1 contains comments of the
style and density expected in your own code, so this would be a good
place to look for examples.

<LI>Elegance and efficiency: is the design as simple as possible,
and does it make good use of computational resources such as CPU
time and memory?

    </UL>
