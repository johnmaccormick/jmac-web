<DL>
  <DT>100%</DT>  
  <DD>  The response is unusually insightful, demonstrating
  not only a deep understanding of the assigned reading, but
  additional background knowledge acquired from extra research on
  the topic. </DD>


  <DT>95%</DT>
  <DD> The response demonstrates not only an excellent understanding
  of the assigned reading, but independent thinking that goes beyond
  the content of the reading. Typically, this type of independent
  thinking is demonstrated by including examples, conclusions, and
  repercussions of the assigned reading that were not discussed in
  that reading.</DD>

  <DT>90%</DT>
  <DD> The response demonstrates a very good understanding of the
  content of the assigned reading, confidently and correctly
  summarizing the main points.  </DD>

  <DT>85%</DT>
  <DD> The response gives strong evidence that all of the material
  was read, but a careful independent analysis of the material may
  not have been performed. </DD>

  <DT>80%</DT>
  <DD> The response shows evidence that some or all of the material
  was read carefully, but some of the reading may have been
  superficial,
  resulting in a vague or misinterpreted understanding of some
  material.</DD>


  <DT>75% or less</DT>
  <DD> The response demonstrates gaps in understanding elementary
  content of the reading, indicating that some or all of the
  material was skipped or read very superficially.</DD>
