<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: August 31</FONT></h4>

Brief introduction to the course, including survey of potential
senior projects.  

<P>Description of test-driven development (the <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia
page on test-driven development</A> contains some basic
  information).  The <A HREF="http://junit.org/">official JUnit
  page</A> is a good place to start for using JUnit -- in
  particular, the <A
  HREF="http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm">JUnit
  Cookbook</A> contains a simple, brief tutorial.  Note that Eclipse
  lets you automate many aspects of JUnit, so make sure to read
  about this, experiment with it, and don't hesitate to ask for help
  from the instructor or your classmates.

<P>Required reading: Quinn 3.4-3.7, plus some Internet research described below.

Prepare and bring to class typed or written answers to the following
discussion questions. (The answers won't be graded.  Informal, brief
notes are fine but they must record specific answers to the
questions backed up by evidence.) The discussion questions are: 

<uL>
  <LI>Quinn Ch3, Questions 13, 14, 26.
</uL>


<P>Required internet research: Use some web research to answer the
following questions. In each case, try to find a reliable source and
bookmark your source so that you can display it in class if asked to
do so.  (Note: Scholarly sources are not required.  Journalistic
articles from established newspapers and news organizations are more
reliable than blogs.  Blogs affiliated with an established news
organization are more reliable than unaffiliated blogs.  Wikipedia
and similar sources may or may not be as reliable as journalistic
sources -- the quality of the information must be assessed carefully
on a case-by-case basis. Be prepared to explain why you believe your
source is reliable.)  Questions:
<OL>
  <LI>Which Western democracy has seriously considered using
  nationwide Internet censorship in the last two years?  What type
  of censorship was proposed?  Is the censorship likely to be
  implemented?
  <LI>Which country recently reinstated a ban on YouTube?  What were
  the reasons behind the country's initial ban on YouTube?
