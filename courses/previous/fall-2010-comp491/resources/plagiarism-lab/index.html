    <H2>Instructions for Detecting Plagiarism lab</H2>
 
    <H3>Structure of the lab</H3>
 
The lab has two main goals: (i) to practice writing a design for
some software before writing any code; (ii) to experience
<I>iteration</I> of the design -- that is, changes to the design
that result when one attempts to implement the original design.
 
The sequence of steps for the lab is as follows:
 
<OL>
 
 
  <LI><B>Read this entire list of instructions:</B> That's what
  you're doing now.</LI>
 
  <LI><B>Read the background information:</B> This is provided  in the section below called "Description of the problem to be solved."</LI> 
 
  <LI><B>Study the <A HREF="plagiarism-framework.zip">code
  framework</A> provided:</B> There is no need to absorb every
  detail; just make sure you are aware of which parts of the problem
  have already been solved for you.</LI>
 
 
  <LI><B>Write Design Document 1:</B> Write a design document (we'll
  call it "Design Document 1")
  explaining how you plan to solve the
    problem.  
 
<UL>
 
 
  <LI> <I>You must submit Design Document 1 to Moodle within 60 minutes
  of the start of the lab.</I> The instructor will clearly announce the
timing and give warnings as the deadline approaches.  Re-submissions
will not be permitted: the first submission is your final
submission.  Late submissions will be penalized by 1% for every
minute of lateness.</LI>
 
  <LI><I>You may not write any code until you have submitted Design
  Document 1.</I> (You may browse the code provided -- see below -- but
you may not edit it.)</LI>
 
<LI> The expected length of Design Document 1 is 0.5-2 pages.</LI>
 
<LI> The document must be written in English, although you
  may also use pseudocode and diagrams if you wish.  We'll be
  studying more details of how to structure design documents later
  in the semester, but for now, just use common sense.  The document
  must describe, clearly and succinctly, the main elements of your
  solution, in such a way that another computer programmer could use
  your document to implement your solution.  Your document should
  mention any important data structures you plan to use
  (e.g. ArrayList, HashMap, arrays, Set), describing what data they
  will contain. The document will be
  far from perfect, because of the time constraints.
  This is an intentional element of the lab, so
  just do your best in the time allowed. </LI>

</UL>
 
</LI>
 
 
  <LI><B>Implement Design Document 1</B>
 
    <UL>
      
<LI>Submit your code by
  the due date for this assignment (i.e. the start of the next
  class).  Code should be submitted to Moodle, as a single zip file
  of <TT>.java</TT> files only.</LI>
 
      <LI>You should make an honest attempt to implement the design
      in your document, but if you discover problems with that
      design, then it is fine to incorporate changes to the design
      in your code.  Indeed, incorporating such changes is one of
      the primary goals of the lab.  You should make a note of
      any design changes, since these will need to be described in
      Design Document 2 (see below).</LI>
 
  <LI>Don't worry too much about efficiency; for this lab,
  correctness is more important.  However, woefully inefficient
  solutions will be penalized a little.  Your solution should
  produce correct output for both the small and medium data sets
  provided below within less than 10 seconds on the lab machines.
  Your code need not work efficiently on the big data set.</LI>
 
 
    </UL>
 
   </LI>
 
  <LI> <B>Write Design Document 2:</B> The main purpose of this
  document is to explain a new design for your solution to the
  problem, incorporating <I>both</I> changes you have implemented in
  the code you submitted, and further changes you would recommend if
  efficiency were a significant consideration.  Divide your document
  into two sections, one for the changes you implemented and another
  for the ones you recommend in future.
 
  <UL>
 
    <LI>Submit your document to Moodle by the due date for this
    assignment.</LI>
 
  <LI>Design Document 2 should be 1-2 pages in length. In the very
  unlikely event that your original design was near-perfect and you
  have few changes to discuss or recommend, you should instead
  discuss potential designs for more challenging versions of the
  problem.
  (e.g. How would you detect near-duplicate documents on the entire
  web?  How would you detect near-duplicate images?)</LI>
 
  <LI> In terms of style, use the same guidelines as for Design
  Document 1.</LI>
 
  </UL>
 
</LI>
 
  <LI><B>Optional:</B> (No extra credit -- for fun only -- but if
  anyone attempts it, we will discuss the results in class.)
  Implement
  some or all of your recommendations for improving efficiency.  Can
  you turn this into a genuinely effective piece of software that
  could be used for detecting plagiarism in a very large corpus of
  documents?</LI>
 
</OL>
 
    <H3>Description of the problem to be solved</H3>
 
The objective is to detect plagiarism in a corpus of text
    documents. In this lab, we adopt a very restrictive definition
    of plagiarism, based on the concept of <I>n-grams</I>. An n-gram
    is a sequence of <I>n</I> consecutive words in a document.  For
    example, if a document consists of the text "the quick brown fox
    jumps over the lazy dog" then the set of all 3-grams in the
    document is: "the quick brown", "quick brown fox", "brown fox
    jumps", ..., "over the lazy", "the lazy dog".  Two documents
    will be defined as suspiciously similar if they have too many
    n-grams in common.  
 
<P>Specifically, the inputs to the algorithm
    will be:
    <UL>
      <LI>A directory containing some documents, each of which
      consists of ASCII text.  The filename of each document to be
      analyzed is guaranteed to end in "<TT>.txt</TT>".
 
      <LI>the <I>phrase length n</I>: the length of the n-grams  to be analyzed</LI>
 
      <LI>the <I>in-common threshold T</I>: if two different
	documents contain <I>T</I> or more of the same n-grams, the
	documents will be considered <I>suspiciously
	similar</I>. </LI>
 
    </UL>
 
    Your program should have a <TT>main</TT> method in the class
    <TT>PlagiarismFinder</TT>, which accepts the above three inputs
    as command line parameters in the given order.  For example, if
    the documents are in a folder called
    <TT>/somewhere/here/sm_doc_set</TT>, the following command line
    runs the program with <I>n</I>=6 and <I>T</I>=100:
 
<PRE>
java PlagiarismFinder /somewhere/here/sm_doc_set 6 100
</PRE>
 
<P>The output of the algorithm will be a list of all pairs of
suspiciously similar documents.  For each pair, the number of
n-grams that appeared in both documents should also be displayed.
Thus, a typical output will be:
 
<PRE>
530 abf0704.txt abf70402.txt
675 abf0704.txt edo26.txt
179 abf70402.txt edo26.txt
423 bef1121.txt edo14.txt
285 catchmeifyoucan.txt ecu201.txt
311 catchmeifyoucan.txt hal10.txt
384 catchmeifyoucan.txt tyc12.txt
1622 jrf1109.txt sra31.txt
</PRE>
 
In fact, the above output is precisely what should be produced when
the above command line (with <I>n</I>=6 and <I>T</I>=100) is run on
the small document set provided below.  Your program may produce the
lines of output in a different order, but the output must otherwise
be identical. 
 
<P>A <A HREF="plagiarism-framework.zip">code framework</A> is
provided to help you get started.  The assignment can be completed
successfully by adding code only to the <TT>PlagiarismFinder</TT>
class, and only in the places indicated by the comment "<TT>// ADD
CODE HERE</TT>".  However, you are welcome to edit the
<TT>NGramGenerator</TT> class and the <TT>PlagiarismFinder</TT>
class as much as you wish, and you can also create new classes if
desired.  
 
<P>Note that there are many details of exactly how to compute
n-grams that have been left unspecified in the above description
(e.g. how to treat capitalization, whitespace, and non-alphabetic
characters).  These details are not discussed further here, because
the provided <TT>NGramGenerator</TT> class computes the n-grams for
you -- please read the code if you're interested in the details, but
if you edit this part of the code, its functionality should remain
the same.
 
<P>Three different data sets are provided: <A
HREF="sm_doc_set.zip">small</A>, <A
HREF="med_doc_set.zip">medium</A>, and <A
HREF="big_doc_set.zip">large</A>.  As noted above, your solution
should work on the small and medium data sets within less than 10
seconds (for typical values of the parameters, say <I>n</I>=6 and
<I>T</I>=100), but it need not work on the large data set.  Each
data set contains a file, called <TT>catchmeifyoucan.txt</TT>, which
is definitely plagiarized -- but there may be other examples of
plagiarism in each data set.

    <H3>Grading</H3>

    <TABLE border compact>

      <TR><TD>  Design Document 1 </TD><TD> 40% </TD></TR>
      <TR><TD>  Design Document 2 </TD><TD> 40% </TD></TR>
      <TR><TD> Code </TD><TD> 20% </TD></TR>
    </TABLE>

<P>The design documents will be graded on clarity, appropriate level
of detail, and quality of writing.  The code will be graded on
correctness only, by running some reference tests.
