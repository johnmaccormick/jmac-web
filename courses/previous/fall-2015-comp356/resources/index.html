<P><b>Important note about what programming languages you need to
know:</b> The textbook and lecture notes give examples from a wide
range of programming languages, including Ada, Python, Pascal, C&#35;,
and Perl. You should always read and understand the abstract concepts
presented in any example. However, in this course you are not required
to understand the details of, or write code in, any languages other
than the following: Java, C, C++, Scheme, Prolog.  Exam questions and
homework questions will refer only to these five languages.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 9: Monday, September 28</FONT></h4>


<P>There are no lecture notes for today.  Please take your own notes
in class.  You need to understand the basics of references and goto
statements in C++, even though none of the programming assignments
requires these.  You also need to understand what operator overloading
means, but you aren't required to learn the syntax. Please see the
example code below for references, goto statements, and operator
overloading:
<ul>
  <li><a href="references.cpp">references.cpp</a>
  <li><a href="operator-overload.cpp">operator-overload.cpp</a>
  <li><a href="goto.cpp">goto.cpp</a>
</ul>



<P>In addition, you should be aware of the content of Dijkstra's 1968
discussion of go to statements and structured programming, <i>Go To
Statement Considered Harmful</i> (available on Moodle).  We will
discuss this famous letter to the editor in class.  Wikipedia has an
excellent article on
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto_statement">goto
statement</a>.  Interestingly, there is a separate Wikipedia page
devoted to the phrase
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">considered
harmful</a>".

<P>We may also use the
file <a href="callStackDemo.java">callStackDemo.java</a> to
demonstrate some of Dijkstra's ideas.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 10: Thursday, October 1</FONT></h4>

  
<ul>
  <li>Revision of heap management.  Go over section 6.3 ("Heap
  Management") of the <a href="c4-data-types-v1.pdf">notes from class
  4</a>. For further details, consult the textbook, section 6.11.8.3,
  pages 298-302.
  <li>Brief discussion of some interesting but non-examinable C++ topics:
    <ul>
      <li>smart pointers (See, for example,
      the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh279674.aspx">discussion
      of smart pointers provided by Microsoft</a> -- but note that
      this discussion is partially specific to Microsoft's Visual
      Studio development environment.)
      <li><a href="http://www.boost.org/">BOOST libraries</a>
      <li>STL, the standard template library (example code: <a href="map.cpp">map.cpp</a>)
    </ul>
  <li>Remainder of time: lab period.
</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 11: Monday, October 5</FONT></h4>

Lecture notes on <a href="c11-scanning-notes-v2.pdf">scanning</a>.

<P>Files for working with
scanning: <a href="cup.jar">cup.jar</a>, <a href="example.lex">example.lex</a>, <a href="sym.java">sym.java</a>, <a href="LexTest.java">LexTest.java</a>, <a href="input-for-LexTest.txt">input-for-LexTest.txt</a>. These
five files are also available as a single zip
file: <a href="scanning.zip">scanning.zip</a>.


<P>In class, a question came up about how JFLex might deal with
ambiguous tokenizing rules.  One option here is to read
the <a href="http://jflex.de/manual.html">manual</a>, but it's very
long and complex. Another option is to conduct some experiments. Some
brief experiments suggest that JFLex always chooses the rule that
consumes the most characters. If rules are tied on this criterion
(i.e. they match the same number of characters), then JFLex uses the
rule that appears earlier in the .lex file.  An example of this is
provided: <a href="hex-demo.zip">hex-demo.zip</a>. Here you'll find a
specification that deliberately allows ambiguity between hexadecimal
numbers and decimal numbers. By swapping lines 29 and 30 in the
example.lex file inside hex-demo.zip, you will see different behaviors
from the scanner on the given input file hex-demo.txt.  Good question,
interesting answer!
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 12: Thursday, October 8</FONT></h4>

Lecture notes on <a href="c12-parser-notes-v1.pdf">parsing</a>.

<P><a href="calculator.zip">calculator.zip</a> for running JFlex and
CUP on the calculator example. Also available as individual
files: <a href="cup.jar">cup.jar</a>, <a href="example.lex">example.lex</a>, <a href="example.cup">example.cup</a>, <a href="input.txt">input.txt</a>.

<P>Solutions for the in-class "repeat" functionality exercise are
available as: <a href="repeat-solution.zip">repeat-solution.zip</a>. I
strongly recommend completing the "repeat" exercise to the best of
your ability before consulting solutions.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 13: Monday, October 12</FONT></h4>

Exam 1.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 14: Thursday, October 15</FONT></h4>

<P>Lecture notes will not be provided for most of this topic. We will
stick reasonably closely to the textbook (Chapter 15, sections 0-5 and
section 11 are the only ones we will cover).

<P>Instructions for editing and running Scheme programs:
<ul>
  <li>To launch the right program:<ul>
      <li>On the Tome Macs: run Applications | Racket v6.2 |
  DrRacket.
	<li>On your own machine: download the latest version
  of <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">DrRacket</a> and run it.
	</ul>
  <li>Always set your language to "Advanced Student": go to Language |
  Choose language | Teaching Languages | How to Design Programs | Advanced Student.
   <li>To test that it works: use the File menu to create a new file,
   put some simple Scheme into it, such as "(+ 3 4)", save the file,
   then click Run.  You should see the output in the Interaction
   Window.
  <li>For
  debugging complicated list structures, it helps to turn off the
  display feature known as "sharing".  To do this, select the
  "Advanced Student" language as described above, then click "Show
  Details", then uncheck the option for "Show sharing in values".
    </ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 16: Thursday, October 22</FONT></h4>


This class involves interactive exercises using lambda expressions,
lists, quote, let, and recursion. Please read textbook sections
15.5.8-15.5.11 and 6.9.  Some <a href="c16-scheme-lists.pdf">lecture
notes</a> are available, but they are very informal and you should
rely mostly on the textbook for this material.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 17: Monday, October 26</FONT></h4>

<P>Please read textbook sections 15.5.12-14.

<P>For more detailed examples, see the <a href="tail-recursion-handout.txt">tail recursion handout.</a>

<P>For a practical example demonstrating difference in CPU time and
memory usage for tail recursive and non-tail recursive implementations
of a given function, see <a href="sum-fn.zip">sum-fn.zip</a>.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 18: Thursday, October 29</FONT></h4>

<P>Please take the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DN2dD7XYUyGoQIkAwWl4li_W8Ff2bd_DQWY4h9OV7bI/viewform?usp=send_form#start=openform">class survey</a>.


<P>Lecture notes on the <a href="c18-scheme-implementation-notes.pdf">implementation of Scheme</a>.

<P>Do you find Scheme's use of parentheses are little excessive? Check
out the <a href="smith-scheme-book-contents.pdf">contents page of the
book <i>Introduction to Scheme</i></a>, by Jerry Smith.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 19: Monday, November 2</FONT></h4>


<P>Most of the class will be a discussion of section 15.11 in the
textbook.  It may also be useful to browse a few of the hits on a web
search for
"<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=functional+vs+imperative">functional
versus imperative</a>".

<P>Example code for using lambda expressions in Java: <a href="JavaLambda.zip">JavaLambda.zip</a>
  
<!-- <\!-- <P>This class will also include some lab time to work on and ask -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- questions about homework assignment 7. -\-> -->


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 20: Thursday, November 5</FONT></h4>

<P>This class covers <b>non-examinable</b> topics: assignments in
Scheme, object-oriented approaches in Scheme, vectors and hash tables
in Scheme,
and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397687.aspx">delegates
and lambda expressions in C&#35;</a>.
Some <a href="c20-examples.zip">example Scheme code</a> is available
(note that this uses the Racket language, not the Advanced Student
language we used for all our previous work).

<P>This class will also include lab time to work on and ask questions
about homework assignment 7. If you have finished the homework, I
recommend working on
the <a href="extra-exercises-from-dybvig.pdf">optional exercises</a>,
taken from Dybvig's book, <i>The Scheme Programming Language</i>.

<P>Some inspiration for the tail recursion
homework: <a href="http://xkcd.com/1270/">http://xkcd.com/1270/</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 21: Monday, November 9</FONT></h4>

<P>This class covers sections 5.1-5.4 and 6.12-6.14 of the textbook.

<P>Contrast the textbook's definition of <i>strongly typed</i> with
the discussion given in the first answer on the following
page: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/430182/is-c-strongly-typed">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/430182/is-c-strongly-typed</a>.

<P>The example
code <a href="type-equivalence-examples.c">type-equivalence-examples.c</a>
provides some examples of type equivalence and inequivalence in C.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 22: Thursday, November 12</FONT></h4>

<P>This class covers sections 5.5-5.8 of the textbook, but sections
5.5.6 and 5.5.7 are excluded.  (These sections cover dynamic scoping,
which we will discuss in class, but which will not be included in any
homework or exam questions.)

<P>The brief code examples used in class are available
as <a href="scope-examples.zip">scope-examples.zip</a>.

<P>Here's an example that will be useful for discussing the
non-examinable topic of dynamic
scoping: <a href="dynamic-scope-example-from-sebesta.pdf">dynamic-scope-example-from-sebesta.pdf</a>.
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 23: Monday, November 16</FONT></h4>

<P>Exam 2.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 24: Thursday, November 19</FONT></h4>

<P>For running Prolog programs:
<ul>
  <li>On the Tome Macs, use XGP, located in Applications | XGP. See detailed <a href="xgp-instructions.html">instructions for using XGP</a>.
  <li>You are welcome to run Prolog on your own machine; I find
   <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a> to be the most
convenient.  But I can't devote any resources to troubleshooting
problems on your own machine. If you encounter any problems that you
cannot solve on your own, please use the Tome Macs instead.
</ul>

<P>We will follow the textbook closely for this topic. Separate
lecture notes will not be provided (mostly).  However, the examples
used in class today are available
as <a href="prolog-demo1.pl">prolog-demo1.pl</a>.

<P>The textbook uses unusual notation for some of the propositional
logic operators (and, or, implies).  We will use the standard notation
as taught in the Dickinson discrete math course.

<P>Some of the in-class examples are taken
from <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog</a>. In
particular, this online book contains a good section on Prolog lists,
which will help to amplify the textbook's
coverage: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog/Lists">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog/Lists</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 25: Monday, November 23</FONT></h4>

<P>Lecture notes on <a href="prolog-and-FOL.pdf">prolog and
first-order logic</a>.

<P>Some very brief <a href="unification-notes.pdf">notes on unification</a>.

<P>Some notes on <a href="prolog-additional-notes.pdf">additional
topics, including negation</a>---these notes will help with the
homework.  The accompanying file <a href="tree.pl">tree.pl</a>
demonstrates a non-trivial Prolog data structure.

<P>We do not study the use of arithmetic in Prolog (so you can skip
the book section 16.6.6).

[Thanksgiving]

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 27: Monday, November 30</FONT></h4>

<P>The file <a href="course-inference.pl">course-inference.pl</a>
contains the example used to explain inference in Prolog.

<P>Instructions for using tracing facilities with XGP:
<ul>
  <li>These instructions use the
  file <a href="course-inference.pl">course-inference.pl</a> as an
  example.  We assume you would like to trace the query <code>
      teachingStudent(maccormick,gao).
      </code>
  <li>Consult the file course-inference.pl, then evaluate the query
  "trace, teachingStudent(maccormick,gao)."
  <li>In the XGP Console window, repeatedly press the Enter key to
  step through the evaluation.
  <li>To terminate tracing, enter "n" (followed by Enter) in the XGP Console window.
</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 28: Thursday, December 3</FONT></h4>

Work on final project in class. Consult with me as necessary to choose
a suitable topic.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 29: Monday, December 7</FONT></h4>

<P>Evaluations.  <b>Exam revision and hints.</b> Then continue working on final project.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 30: Thursday, December 10</FONT></h4>

<P>Work on final project in class.

<P>There was a typo in the summary schedule, which incorrectly
specified the deadline for the final project as midnight on 12/12.
This typo was fixed on 12/7, specifying the correct deadline as
midnight on Friday, December 11. However, due to potential confusion
over this deadline, I will be happy to grant a 24-hour extension to
anyone who wants it.  And, as announced in class, you are welcome to
use any remaining late days for this assignment. But I recommend you
submit on Friday and spend time studying for your exams instead.
  
<P>Here's an interesting piece of research from 2013 related to some
of our work on C/C++ earlier in the
semester: <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2517349.2522728">Towards
Optimization-Safe Systems: Analyzing the Impact of Undefined
Behavior</a>, by Xi Wang, Nickolai Zeldovich, M. Frans Kaashoek,
Armando
Solar-Lezama. Some <a href="http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp13/talks/wang_stack_se05_04.pdf">slides</a>
used by the first author when presenting the paper are also available.
Note the puzzle on the last page of the slides -- it is highly
relevant to this class!  A file containing the relevant code from the
puzzle is available: <a href="puzzle.c">puzzle.c</a>.
