As stated on the syllabus, exams in this course are open note.  Any
printed or written material may be consulted during an
exam. Electronic devices may be used only to consult the following:
(i) e-books; (ii) resources on the class website. Electronic devices
may not be used for any other purpose, unless stated otherwise in the
exam. In particular, you may not write or compile any source code on
an electronic device, and you may not perform web searches.

<P>Exams will consist of a combination of true-false questions, short
answer questions, and questions requiring longer answers and/or
writing small snippets of code.

<P>Technically, exams may ask questions about anything covered in
class, in the lecture notes, in homework assignments, or in the
background readings assigned from the textbook.  In practice, however,
a strong majority of questions will be related to homework questions,
or to examples covered during a class lecture.

<h3>Exam 1</h3>

Exam 1 covers material from course topics 1 and 2 -- that is, from
classes 1-10 inclusive, and covering homework assignments 1-4 inclusive.

<h3>Exam 2</h3>

Exam 2 covers material from course topics 3 and 4 -- that is, from
classes 11-20 inclusive.

<!-- <P>Hints: the exam will be worth 75 points (one point per minute). -->
<!-- It will probably comprise -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>25 true/false questions (1 point each) -->
<!--   <li>a 15-point question asking you to convert a loop written in C -->
<!--   into a recursive Scheme function (which does not have to be tail recursive) -->
<!--   <li>a 15-point  question asking you to convert a recursive Scheme function into a tail recursive Scheme function -->
<!--   <li>a 5-point question asking you to curry a Scheme function -->
<!--   <li>three other 5-point questions -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <h3>Final Exam</h3> -->

<!-- The final exam is cumulative, covering all topics with approximately -->
<!-- equal emphasis. The style of the exam will be similar to the two -->
<!-- in-class exams, including some true/false questions, some short-answer -->
<!-- questions, and some code-writing questions. -->
