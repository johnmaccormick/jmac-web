<ul>
  <li><a href="hw4.pdf">The original assignment</a>
  <li>Some clarifications on the original assignment (added 9/23/13, 4pm):<ol>
      <li>Do not attempt the extra credit without first doing the
      regular assignment.
      <li>The original intention of the assignment was that you would
      not use any part of the standard template library (STL) in your
      solution---the main idea was to practice using elementary C++
      concepts such as inheritance, and arrays of pointers.  However,
      since the assignment did not specifically say you can't use the
      STL, you won't lose any points for doing so.
      <li>If you do attempt the extra credit, please submit two
      versions of your solution: the first version should be the
      attempt on the regular assignment, and the second version should
      be the attempt for extra credit.
      <li>To complete the extra credit version, you will need the STL
      (or, you could write your own data structure, but that
      would be a lot of work and I don't recommend it).
