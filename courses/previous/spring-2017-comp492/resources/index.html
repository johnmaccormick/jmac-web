<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 12: Tuesday April 18</FONT></h4>

Discussion on two classic CS papers, selected by popular vote.

<P>This discussion will not be divided into groups. 

<!-- Details will be provided later. -->
<P>The papers are:

<ul>
  <li>Ken Thompson's classic 1984 paper,
 originally delivered as the acceptance lecture for his Turing award:
 <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358210">Reflections on
 trusting trust</a>, Communications of the ACM, Volume 27 Issue 8, Aug
 1984, pages 761-763 (click on the "PDF" link). Notes:
<ul>
  <li>A full copy of the program presented by Thompson in Figure 1 of
  the paper is also
  available: <a href="thompson-program.c">thompson-program.c</a>
  (actually, this is a simplified and adapted version of the program
  but uses the same ideas).
  <li> If you are interested, you can do an ungraded minilab related
  to this discussion (we may also have time to do it in class). Ask the
  instructor if you're interested. In addition to the
  above <a href="thompson-program.c">thompson-program.c</a> you may
  need to use the following tools for working with self-reproducing
  programs: <a href="self-rep-tools.zip">self-rep-tools.zip</a>.
</ul>
<li>Sutherland, I. E. (1963). Sketchpad: a man-machine graphical
communication system. <i>Proceedings of the Spring Joint Computer
Conference</i>, 1963, pages 329-346. This is a description of a system
that was influential in the development of human computer
interaction. The author received a Turing award in 1988. A copy of the
paper is available on Moodle.


</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 14: Tuesday May 2</FONT></h4>

This class will take the form of an afternoon tea party, from 4PM to
5PM, at the instructor's house (details sent via email). The

Feynman, <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~yang/RFeynman_plentySpace.pdf">There's
Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a> (this talk has its
own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom">Wikipedia
