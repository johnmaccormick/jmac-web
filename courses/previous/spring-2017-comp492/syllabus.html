    <b>Instructor:</b> John MacCormick

    <P><b>Acknowledgment:</b> this syllabus and many other course materials
    are closely based on the materials developed by Professor Grant

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>The Senior Seminar (COMP491/492 combined) has three main components: 
<OL>
<LI>A year long project with two options:
<UL>
<LI>Honors Research Projects: Students pursuing departmental honors
will use their honors research project as their senior seminar
project.
<LI>H/FOSS Projects: Students not pursuing departmental honors will
become involved with a Free and Open Source Project (FOSS or
Humanitarian - H/FOSS) and complete several assignments using their
project during the first semester (491/fall) before planning
additional work on the project to be completed during the second
semester (492/spring).
</UL>
<LI>Readings, in-class exercises, homeworks and class discussions
related to Free and Open Source Software (H/FOSS) and Software
Engineering (491/fall);
<LI><b>Readings and discussions on ethical, legal and social issues
    related to computing (492/spring).</b>
</OL>

<h2>Book</h2>

The required textbook is Michael Quinn's <i>Ethics for the Information
  Age</i>. Any recent edition is acceptable.

<h2>Class meetings</h2>

Tome 231, Tuesdays 3-5pm. In addition, please note the following
required events that occur outside the regular class meeting time
slot:
<ul>
  <li>Dickinson science symposium, Wednesday, April 12,

</table>

<h2>Course Components</h2>

<h3>Preparation/Attendance/Engagement (PAE)</h3>

PAE will be graded according to the same criteria and rubric as for
the <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~braught/courses/cs491f16/syllabus.html">fall</a>,
with the following modifications. On some discussion days, there will
be a brief reading quiz worth approximately 5 PAE points. You will not
be notified of reading quizzes in advance.  Additional forms of
preparation may be required (e.g. posting discussion questions to a
Moodle forum), but you will be notified in advance of any additional
requirements. There will be no blog or reflective writing requirement.

<h3>Assignments A1a, A1b, A1c: Project Checkpoints</h3>
      
Grading of the three project checkpoints will be identical to the fall
semester, except that there is no presentation component. Hence, the
three graded components are: (i) Slack live-logs; (ii) weekly wiki
summaries; (iii) effectiveness. For detailed rubrics, please see
the <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~braught/courses/cs491f16/syllabus.html">fall
syllabus</a>. For the dates on which project checkpoints will be
graded, please see the online course schedule.
      
<h3>Assignments A2-A7</h3>

Assignments A2-A7 are described on a separate assignments webpage.


<h3>Late work policy</h3>

Because of the nature of the assignments in this course (most of which
involve presentation or interaction), it is not possible to grant
extensions or "late days". Late assignments will typically receive
little or no credit.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>Please take the time to read
the <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/info/20273/dean_of_students/867/community_standards/2">Academic

Community Standards</a>. Violations of this policy are considered
serious transgressions, so you should be especially certain that you
understand your rights and responsibilities under it. Students
suspected of academic dishonesty will be subject to the process
outlined in
the <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/69/student_conduct">Student
Conduct</a> pages. The specific collaboration policies for each
component of this course are detailed in the assignments. If you are
unsure about whether or not certain kinds of collaboration are
permissible on an assignment or in this course, ask your instructor.
