  <LI>Lecture 8: 
    <UL>
      <LI>An explanation of the <A
      HREF="instability-of-SR-flip-flop.pdf">instability
      of the SR flip-flop</A>.  Also note that, in my
      opinion, the first paragraph of page 134 in the
      text book (the discussion of instability of the SR
      flip-flop) is potentially misleading: an SR
      flip-flop without a clock is perfectly stable when
      S=R=1, and results in Q = Qbar =
      0.  It is only when we have a clock that S=R=1
      becomes a problem, because immediately after the
      clock cycle, the inputs S, R are killed and the
      resulting state depends on which one happens to
      die off first, resulting in either Q=0 or Q=1.
      Please see the linked document above for a more
      detailed explanation.  The difference between the
      first two links below should also make this
      distinction clear.</LI>

<h3>Exams</h3>
    <UL>
      <LI>Midterm Exam 1: The exam covers Lectures 1-8.
      Technically, any material covered in any lecture
      or any assigned reading is eligible to be
      examined.  However, in practice, the vast majority
      of questions
      will be similar to either a homework question, one
      of the puzzle questions from the puzzle sheets in
      lectures 7 and 8, or this <A
      HREF="exam1-example-question.pdf">example
      question</A>. Therefore, the best method of
      preparation is to ensure you can effortlessly and
      correctly complete all homework questions, puzzle
      questions, and the example question.  Note that
      homework solutions are provided outside the
      instructor's office. It is highly advisable to
      show your working in all exam answers, as partial
      credit for incorrect answers can only be given if
      your working demonstrates a correct understanding
      of the concepts being examined.  This exam is open
      book, meaning you can bring and use any printed or
      handwritten materials. However, no electronic
      devices of any kind whatsoever may be used.</LI>
      
      <LI>Midterm Exam 2: The exam covers Lectures 9-15.
      Technically, any material covered in any lecture
      or any assigned reading is eligible to be
      examined.  However, in practice, the vast majority
      of questions
      will be similar to one of the homework
      questions. Therefore, the best method of
      preparation is to ensure you can effortlessly and
      correctly complete all homework questions.  Note
      that homework solutions are provided outside the
      instructor's office. It is highly advisable to
      show your working in all exam answers, as partial
      credit for incorrect answers can only be given if
      your working demonstrates a correct understanding
      of the concepts being examined.  This exam is open
      book, meaning you can bring and use any printed or
      handwritten materials. However, no electronic
      devices of any kind whatsoever may be used.</LI>

      <LI>Final Exam: <UL>
			<LI>The exam covers Lectures
			1-20.
      Technically, any material covered in any lecture
      or any assigned reading is eligible to be
      examined.  However, in practice, the vast majority
      of questions will be similar to one of the
      homework
      questions, one of the in-class exam questions, or
      one of the worksheets available on this
      webpage. (Pay special attention to the caching and
      virtual memory worksheets from lecturers and 17
      and 18, which were not covered by the previous
      exams.) Therefore, the best method of
      preparation is to ensure you can effortlessly and
      correctly complete all homework questions,
      previous exam questions, and worksheets.  Note
      that homework solutions are provided outside the
      instructor's office. It is highly advisable to
      show your working in all exam answers, as partial
      credit for incorrect answers can only be given if
      your working demonstrates a correct understanding
      of the concepts being examined.</LI>
			<LI> This exam is open
      book, meaning you can bring and use any printed or
      handwritten materials. However, no electronic
      devices of any kind whatsoever may be used. </LI>
       
			<LI> The final exam will take
			place on Saturday,
      December 13 at 9 a.m., in Tome 117 <B>(not our
      usual classroom, Tome 231)</B>.  The exam will be
      proctored by Professor Jennifer Froelich.
      Professor Froelich is not able to answer
      content-specific questions.  If you have a
      question about, or suspect an error in, the exam,
      make a clear note of it on your exam paper,
      clearly stating any additional assumptions you
      have made, and complete the question to the best
      of your ability. </LI>
