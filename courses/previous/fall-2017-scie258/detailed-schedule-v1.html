<b>Please remember to hit "refresh" whenever you visit this page. It will
      be updated often.</b>

<h3>A note on required readings</h3>

The only required readings for this course are taken from our textbook
by Gribbin. Details of each required reading are given in the schedule
below. Readings should be completed before the first time the class
meets on the day for which the reading is assigned. As described
elsewhere, take notes on your reading and be prepared for lightweight
quizzes on the readings. The assigned readings average about 10 pages
per day, but the first few days are more like 20-25 pages as we build
essential knowledge for our visits to the Royal Society, Greenwich,
Royal Institution and Down House.

<h3>Detailed schedule</h3>

<font size="+0" color="red">The first 17 days have been moved to the
bottom, to reduce the need for scrolling down.</font>

    
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Sunday, September 17, 2017</FONT></h4>

No required reading. HW3c is due.

    <P>There is no required morning activity. Suggestions include (all
    of these are either free or count as reimbursable activities):
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://museumofbatharchitecture.org.uk">Museum
      of Bath Architecture</a> (6 pounds)
  <li>the <a href="http://no1royalcrescent.org.uk/">One Royal Crescent Museum</a> (7 pounds)
  <li>the
    <a href="https://www.janeausten.co.uk/">Jane Austen Centre</a>
    (8.50 pounds)
  <li>the <a href="https://www.romanbaths.co.uk">Roman Baths</a>
    (14 pounds)
  <li>free and interesting alternative to the Roman baths: go into the
  "pump room" entrance to the right of the Roman Baths. Our guide told
  me this is a public area even though a restaurant leases some of the
  space. You can taste some of the famous "bath" water and view the
  medieval baths for free.
  <li><a href="http://www.holburne.org/">The Holburne Museum</a> (free)
  <li><a href="http://www.trailhiker.co.uk/bath-to-bradford-on-avon/">walk up the canal towards Bradford-on-Avon</a> (free)
  <li>visit <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/prior-park-landscape-garden">Prior
    Park Landscape Garden</a> (walk there or take a bus, entry 7
    pounds). Our guide pointed out the Prior Park mansion opposite the
    first crescent we visited.
</ul>
If interested in the walk or garden (last two items above), you can
optionally let me know and I will be happy to accompany and/or guide you.

<P>1:45pm: Meet outside the Herschel Museum of Astronomy.

<P>2:00pm: Talk (20 minutes) and self-guided tour (about 45 minutes) of the Herschel Museum.

<P><b><font color="red">NEW SESSION (added 9/16/17)</font></b><br>
  4:00-5:30pm: Classroom session in the "conservatory" (adjacent to
the restaurant area) at the YMCA.  
 
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Monday, September 18, 2017</FONT></h4>

<b>Required reading</b>. Gribbin, first half of chapter 9, pages
319-338. This reading covers early geological thinking (especially
Lyell). It is relevant to today's visit to Cheddar Gorge. But there
are also strong connections to Darwin and evolution, which help us
place Darwinism in historical context.

<P>Optional reading:
A <a href="http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Stout27-t32.html">19th
century pamphlet about the smallpox vaccine</a>.

<P>Note: You may prefer to bring your own lunch today, rather than
relying on the cafe at Cheddar Gorge. The Waitrose supermarket near
the YMCA opens at 7:30 AM.

<P>8:40am: Board the coach outside the hostel.

<P>8:45am: Coach departs the hostel, arriving at Jenner Museum
  approximately 10 AM. Complete Edward Jenner Exercise (HW5b) based on
  self-guided tour.

<P>12:15pm: Coach departs Jenner Museum, arriving Cheddar Gorge/Caves
  approximately 1:30 PM.

<P>From 1:30pm: Allocate your time at the Gorge however you
wish. Consult the operator's
"<a href="https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/visitor-info/plan-your-day">plan
your day</a>" page for details on the options, which include Gough's
Cave, Cox's Cave, a 3-mile clifftop walk, and the Museum of
Prehistory. Make a few notes on your visit, but great detail is
not required.

<P>5:00pm: Coach departs the Gorge, arriving back at the Bath YMCA
approximately 6 PM.

  

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Tuesday, September 19, 2017</FONT></h4>

<b>Required reading</b>. Gribbin, introduction, pages xvii-xxii. Now
we are trying to get a larger perspective on what we have seen so
far. Gribbin's introduction should help to spark that.

<P>Note: Please bring snacks and/or your own lunch today. It looks
like the cafe at Avebury will be closed, and there will probably not
be time to get food at the Stonehenge cafe (it's not near the stones,
and we need to stay together as a group).  The Waitrose supermarket
near the YMCA opens at 7:30 AM and is a good option for bringing
lunch.

<P>8:15am: Board the coach outside the hostel, with our guide for the day, Luke. 

<br>8:20am: Coach departs for Avebury.
  
<br>9:30am: Arrive at Avebury; tour of Avebury Henge.

<br>11:00am: Alexander Keiller Museum and Barn Gallery. This is also
the best place to eat the lunch you brought.
  
<br>12:00pm: Depart Avebury
<br>12:15pm: West Kennet Long Barrow 
<br>12:45pm: Leave for Stonehenge
<br>1:30pm: Arrive Stonehenge
<br>1:45pm-3:45pm: Stonehenge tour

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</FONT></h4>

On arrival at Heathrow, meet Profs MacCormick and/or Mitchell at the
arrivals area in Terminal 3 (see details in
the <a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=716436">flight
and arrival instructions document</a> ). 

<P>At the meeting point, you will be given an envelope containing some
cash (probably about 100 pounds), a card containing emergency phone
numbers, and some printed instructions
("<a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=716437">Instructions
for the first day</a> ") on how to get to the hotel via the
Underground plus other useful information and required activities for the day.

<P>You can leave your Norwich bag at the meeting point. The professors
will put you into small groups and instruct you to make your own way
to the hotel. Once at your hotel, use the afternoon to get some lunch,
  get a cell phone, and buy your 16-25 Rail Pass.

<P>All-year students only: a professor will meet you at the hotel
  after lunch and go with you to pick up your BRP from the post
  office.

<P>If problems arise during the afternoon, please call/text/email
me. Or you can probably find me in the lobby of the Ridgemount.

<P>Optional reading: Do some background reading (Wikipedia is fine) on
the Magna Carta, Gutenberg Bible, Lindisfarne Gospels, or anything
else that interests you at
the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/events/treasures-of-the-british-library">Ritblat
Gallery</a>.
  
<P>6pm: Meet me at the Ritblat Gallery of the British Library. This is
our first academic event, so the academic travel expectations apply
(i.e. bring your notebook and pen, don't have your cell phone out,
don't be late, make sure to note two or three items for your timeline
assignment.)

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Thursday, August 31, 2017</FONT></h4>

No required reading is due today, but it is recommended to get a head
start on the readings for the next few days, which are all longer than
average.

<P>11:45am-12:15pm: UEA registration and visa check. This will be in
the lobby of the Ridgemount. Please arrive in approximately
alphabetical order by last name (A-M 11:45, N-Z 12:00pm). The science
course students are being processed after the humanities course
students, so timings are approximate.

<P>Before you get on the tube: top up your Oyster card so that it has
at least 33 pounds of credit, and use this to buy a 7-day travel card
for zones 1 and 2. (You won't physically get a "travel card," but your
Oyster card will now give you unlimited travel within zones 1 and 2
for the next week, without requiring any additional credit.)
  
<P>1:45pm: Meet outside the Wellcome Wolfson building on Queen's Gate
  (165 Queen's Gate, London, SW7 5HE). We will go in together for the talk.

<P>2PM: talk by Natasha McEnroe, Keeper of Medicine at the London
  Science Museum.

<P>After the talk: Complete the following assignment at the Science
Museum. Find something in the museum that is relevant either to your
major or to some other course you have taken at Dickinson. Make a few
notes about it and be prepared to speak for a few minutes. This
assignment must be done individually and you must not knowingly use
the same topic as another student. (Feel free to visit the museum as a
whole in groups, but make sure to do this assignment yourself. )
  
<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, September 1, 2017</FONT></h4>

<b>Required reading</b>. Gribbin chapter 4 excerpt, pages
121-142. This reading is preparation for our Royal Society visit, with
information on Huygens, Boyle and the early days of the Royal Society.

bring your printed mapguide for today's navigation exercise. (I
recommend bringing it every day, but especially today.)

Spitalfields Market and eat lunch there. Then (again, optionally) I
will give you an ungraded exercise for navigating in London, to be
done in small groups of 2-4.  If we get separated on the trip to
Spitalfields or you need to find me after lunch before you set off on
the navigation exercise, I will be based at the coffee shop
called <a href="https://departmentofcoffee.com/spitalfields">Department
of Coffee and Social Affairs</a> (6 Lamb St). If you complete the
navigation exercise, there is a reward. See the exercise for details.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Saturday, September 2, 2017</FONT></h4>

completing this assignment. 

<P>2:45pm: Meet inside the main entrance to the Museum of London at
  150 London Wall. 

<P>3:00pm: Visit the Museum of London. (Sometimes free tours are
available and if you are interested in joining one, please do

consider the following discussion question:
  <blockquote>
    What historical factors enabled London to become a leader in
    science and technology from 1600 to the present day?  What
    historical factors inhibited scientific and technological progress
    in London?
  </blockquote>
Make sufficient notes that you can contribute to a discussion of this
topic at Wednesday's classroom session. Connect your ideas to
specific exhibits and items within the museum.

visiting Down House: second half of chapter 9, pages 339-358 (on
Darwin and Wallace); first part of chapter 14, pages 529-532

the website, it appears the tea room at Down House is somewhat limited
in selection and quantities.

<P>8:25am: Board coach on Gower Street immediately outside the hotel.

<P>8:30am: Coach departs. We will arrive at Down House around 10 AM and

      <ul>
	<li>Museum of Science 12:15-1:15pm; walk 1:45-3:45pm; 
	  </ul>
      </ul>

<P>Group B, while you are waiting for your scheduled activities to
begin, feel free to relax, grab coffee, enjoy the Covered Market. If
you're looking for something more intellectual, try the Ashmolean
Museum (art) or Pitt Rivers Museum (archaeology and anthropology). Or
climb the Carfax tower (costs a couple of pounds, but counts as a
reimbursable activity). You may also be able to go into an interesting
exhibition at the Weston Library.

<P>The museum curators have recommended their "pocket curator" app
(available for android and iPhone). You are welcome to download and
use that on your phone in the museum if you wish.
  
<P>Optional: Meet me for a drink at the Lamb and Flag pub on St Giles
at 3:45pm. It is about a 20-minute walk from there to the train
station.
  
<p>From 4:15pm onwards: Make your own way back to the station in good
time for your train. Check your ticket to see what train you are on:
some are on the 5:01 PM and some on the 5:30 PM.

    National Portrait Gallery. They are both near Trafalgar Square but
    they are completely separate. For this assignment, you want the
    National Portrait Gallery. The main entrance is on St Martin's
    Place.
    <li>There are some important updates to the printed version of the
assignment on the <a href="hw/hw5c-updates.html">HW5c updates</a>
page.
  </ul>

<P>11:45am: Meet in room 20 of the National Portrait Gallery (level 2,
at the very back). Turn in your assignment and be ready for a brief
discussion/quiz/etc.

<P>Royal Society group 3 archival research from
  2pm. (See <a href="roysoc-instructions.html">Royal Society groups
  and instructions</a>.)
  
<P>1:45pm: [For everyone except Royal Society group 3] Meet outside
the Bank of England Museum on Bartholomew Ln, London EC2R 8AH. (Don't
go to the main entrance of the bank on Threadneedle Street.)

<P>2:00pm: 60-minute presentation on "The Bank of England, past and
present," followed by self-guided tour of the Museum. Don't miss the
chance to hold and lift a gold bar worth 400,000 pounds.

<P>6:15pm: [For those going to King Lear.] Meet outside the hotels on
Gower Street. We will travel together to the Globe for the start of
the play at 7:30 PM. I think you'll enjoy the play much more if you
try to understand the main points of the plot beforehand. It is rather
complex and very interesting. Wikipedia has a
good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear#Synopsis">synopsis</a>
on its King Lear page.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Thursday, September 14, 2017</FONT></h4>

<b>Required reading</b>. Gribbin, first part of chapter 8, pages
285-300. This reading starts to flesh out the 18th century for
us. There may be some connections to the Natural History Museum (which
we visit today), but the main goal is to fill a gap in our timeline
and understand some of the early developments in electricity
(including the US hero Benjamin Franklin!).

<P>Between 10 AM and 11 AM: I will be waiting in
    the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/galleries-and-museum-map/treasures-in-the-cadogan-gallery.html">Cadogan
    Gallery</a> of the Natural History Museum. Please check in with me
    there individually (we won't meet as a group). I won't be doing a
    formal quiz, but I will chat with you about the reading,
    individually or in small groups. Be prepared, with the help of
    your notes, to contribute to a meaningful conversation that will
    form part of your PAE grade. After chatting with me, you can start
    the following assignment.

<P><b>Natural History Museum assignment</b>: Complete this assignment
  in your notebook, and be prepared to describe your results at a
  subsequent class meeting. Note that the museum is divided into three
  zones, as follows: Green Zone for birds, ecology, fossils,
  archaeology, minerals; Red Zone for volcanoes, earthquakes, early
  earth, evolution of life, geology, mineralogy, wind, water, weather;
  Blue Zone for dinosaurs, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals,
  marine invertebrates, human biology. There are two steps in the
  assignment:
  <ol>
    <li>Choose one of the items in the Cadogan Gallery. Give a clear
  one-sentence description of the item. Then write a paragraph or so
  describing its relevance to the history of science and connections
  to people, ideas, and historical forces we have studied in the
  course.
    <li>Find two other items elsewhere in the museum (not the Cadogan
    Gallery) that have relevance to your chosen Cadogan Gallery
    item. These two items must come from different Zones.  For each of the two
    items, give a clear one-sentence description and another sentence
    or two describing the connections to your Cadogan Gallery item.
  </ol>
  There is plenty more to see in the museum, of course. Follow your
  own interests after you complete the assignment. The rest of the day
  is free to pursue HW4 research, reimbursable activities, or other
  interests.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Friday, September 15, 2017</FONT></h4>

Optional reading: there are several large important chunks of the
textbook that have not yet been assigned, but they don't specifically
apply to any of our remaining activities and they are not being
assigned as required reading. However, if you are looking to fill in
some important gaps in our coverage, I recommend choosing one or more
of the following excerpts, depending on your interests: Ch4 (1st
half), Ch6 (1st half), Ch7 (2nd half), Ch8 (2nd half), Ch11 (2nd
half). Read these at your own discretion over the remainder of our
time in London and Bath.

<P>Complete the British Museum assignment (HW5d) at any time
today. The museum is open 10am-830pm. There's one small correction to
this assignment. In Question 3(a), which applies to Room 1, the hint
refers to some information in front of cases 1 and 3, but that
information is now in front of cases 11 and 13.

<P>The rest of the day is unscheduled. This is our last day in London,
so it's a good opportunity to do some final archival research if you
need to for HW4b.
