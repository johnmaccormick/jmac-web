    <H1>Directions to D'Arcy Thompson Room</H1>

The D'Arcy Thompson Room is on level 2 of building 5, at the western
end of the Computing Sciences (CMP) area. It is very close to my office.
    
<P>At night, you cannot access the sciences building from the walkway
side. Instead, enter from either the Zuckerman Building or the
Lawrence Stenhouse Building by crossing one of the bridges into the
sciences building.
