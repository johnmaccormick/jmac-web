    <h2>Optional cultural events</h2>

Several cultural events are being offered as optional components of
the SCIE258 course. While not directly related to the theme of our
course, these events will contribute to the more general goals of
global study through cultural understanding. The events are optional
and will have no effect on your course grade.

<p>See below for details about the individual events. Dickinson will
be paying half the cost of the tickets and you will be responsible for
the other half of the cost for each event you choose to
attend. Students taking the humanities course are also welcome to sign
up for these events on the sign-up sheet linked below (Dickinson will
pay 50% of the cost for humanities students too).

<P>By <b>Wednesday, July 5</b>, please indicate which events you would
like to attend on the following sign-up sheet:

      <LI><A HREF="https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/effmbp">Prom
      Concert</A> at the Royal Albert Hall at 7:30 PM on Tuesday,
      September 5. Tickets cost 15 pounds so the cost to you is 7.5
      pounds. This is in a spectacular venue with a great program of
      20th-century classical music including a Bartok piano concerto
      and a Dvorak Symphony. </LI>
      <li>Shakespeare's <a href="http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/globe-theatre/king-lear-2017">King
	  Lear</a> at the Globe theatre, 7:30 PM on Monday, September
	  11. Tickets are 5 pounds so the cost to you is 2.5
	  pounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_Globe">Shakespeare's
	  Globe</a> is a reconstruction of the playhouse built and
	  used by Shakespeare's own theater company. We will be
	  standing in the open-air "yard" area, watching the play on
	  foot the same way most of the audience would have in
	  Shakespeare's time. If it rains, we will get wet!
      <li><a href="http://thecockpit.org.uk/show/gate">Gate</a>, a new
      play by Artemis Fitzalan Howard at the Cockpit Theater,
      Thursday, September 14 at 7:30 PM. Tickets are 18 pounds so the
      cost to you is 9 pounds. The play sounds like it should be very
      interesting for our group, since it challenges some of our
      society's ideas about self-interest and scientific certainty.
