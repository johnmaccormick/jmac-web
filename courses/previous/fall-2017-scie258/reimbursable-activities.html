    <H1>Reimbursable activities for SCIE258</H1>

    Dickinson will be paying directly for all the required academic
    events listed on the course schedule. In addition, each SCIE258 student
    will have a budget for further "reimbursable
    activities."  This means that Dickinson will reimburse you in cash
    for entrance fees and other direct costs associated with
    activities you choose to pursue in London or Bath, subject to a
    few conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>The total amount of reimbursed costs must not exceed 70 pounds.
      <li>Receipts must be submitted for all reimbursements.
      <li>Reimbursable activities must have some intellectual content
      or cultural significance, but they do not need to have a direct
      link to the topic of our course. Activities that are primarily
      entertainment are not reimbursable. Examples: touring
      St. Paul's Cathedral or the Houses of Parliament is
      reimbursable; the London Eye is not reimbursable. Check with the
      instructor if you're unsure.
      <li>Sports events, musicals, concerts, plays, ballet, and opera
are not automatically eligible, but will be given serious
consideration. Please consult the instructor in advance and explain
why you believe your proposed event has cultural significance or
intellectual merit.
    </ul>
    
    <P>I encourage you to be creative in spending your reimbursable
    activity budget. Pursue your own interests, whatever they may be!
      But, if you want some suggestions, here are a few:
      Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum,
Anaesthesia Heritage Centre,
Bethlem,
Clockmakers' Museum,
      Florence Nightingale Museum,
      Freud Museum,
Grant Museum,
Guildhall,
Houses of Parliament,
Imperial war museum,
      Museum of London (Docklands site--the City site is on our required schedule),
      Roman baths (in Bath),
St Paul's Cathedral,
      St. Bart's Hospital Museum,
      Tate Gallery, Tate Modern,
Thames boat trip (go west from Westminster, since we go from Greenwich to Westminster as a scheduled activity),
Tower of London,
Westminster Abbey,
      Whitehall,
      any of the guided walks offered by <a href="http://www.walks.com/">London Walks</a>
      (highly recommended!).
Also check out the Humanities course schedule and see if any of their activities might interest you.

<P><strike>To claim a reimbursement, put one or more receipts in an
envelope. On the outside of the envelope, write your name and a list
of the activities, individual costs, and total cost. I will try to
    give you the cash within seven days of receiving the envelope.</strike>

<P>New, simplified system for reimbursements: Reimbursements will take
place at the end of each classroom session. Write your name on each
receipt. When you give me your receipts, I will immediately reimburse
you.

<P>Finally, if you signed up for any of
  the <a href="cultural-events.html">optional cultural activities</a>,
  you may claim back your half of the cost as part of your
  reimbursable activity budget. <strike>Submit an envelope as above, but no
    receipt is required for these specific activities.</strike>
