      <LI><A HREF="hwJ.pdf">homework assignment J</A>. Note that there
      is no homework assignment "I". (Airlines and theaters often do
      the same thing -- seats go straight from H to J.) This
      assignment comes with a free one-day extension -- submit by
      11:59pm on Friday, May 1.  Questions J2, J3, and J4 are ungraded
      but at least one of them is likely to be on the final exam.
      <LI><A HREF="hw-revision-cover-sheet.pdf">homework revision
      cover sheet</A> -- use this to earn back 50&#37; of the points
      you lost on any assignment. You can do this for every assignment
      if you want. Update (4/30/15): Sorry, but you cannot submit a
      revision for homework assignment J; and revisions for all other
      homework assignments must be submitted by noon on Tuesday, May
      5.</LI>
