<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: Tuesday, January 19</FONT></h4>

<P>We will go through the syllabus and an overview of the course,
corresponding to WCBC Chapter 1.

<P>If there's time, we will try to run and edit some Python programs
  using IDLE. Key points:
<ul>
  <li>Always use Version 3.x of Python for this course
  <li>You can download Python 3 and install it on your own laptop etc.
  <li>Python is also available on all department iMacs in Tome: use Finder | Applications | Python 3.4 | IDLE
</ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Thursday, January 22</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: Chapters 1 and 2 of WCBC.

<P>Warm-up: use containsGAGA.py to determine whether the
file <a href="CAGT.txt">CAGT.txt</a> contains the string "GAGA".

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 3: Tuesday, January 27</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 3.

<P><a href="class3-handout.pdf">class3-handout.pdf</a>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 4: Thursday, January 29</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 4.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 5: Tuesday, February 3</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 5.

<P>Minilab (ungraded): using JFLAP,
<ul>
  <li>experiment with <a href="binary-incrementer.jff">binary-incrementer.jff</a>
  <li>Create and test the basic version of LastTtoA (fig 5.5)
  <li>Create and test the abbreviated version of LastTtoA (fig 5.6)
  <li>Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings,
  changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c"
  <li>Optional extras: Create a machine that accepts any string of
  length 10 or more that also contains an "a".
</ul>

<!--   <li>Optional extras: (i) Create a machine that increments a binary -->
<!--   number. (ii) Create a machine that accepts any string of length 10 -->
<!--   or more that also contains an "a". -->



<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6: Thursday, February 5.</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 6.


<!-- <P>Lecture -->
<!-- notes: <a href="class06-rices-theorem-v2.pdf">class06-rices-theorem-v2.pdf</a>. -->

<!-- <P>HW1 solutions are available on Moodle. -->

<P>Minilab (ungraded, but important and fun):

  <UL>

    <LI>Download the
<!-- <A -->
<!--     HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/tu.jff">Universal -->
<!--     Turing machine</A> -->
<A
    HREF="tu.jff">Universal
    Turing machine</A>
 of Lucas and Jarvis (see also their <A
    HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg0.html">explanatory
    webpage</A> if you're interested).</LI>


    <LI>Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the
      previous class, but using only the alphabet a,b (and blanks).
      If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of
      <a href="LastBtoA.jff">LastBtoA</a>.  We will use LastBtoA as an
      input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      <LI>Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas
      and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
      An <A HREF="example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf">explanation
      of the encoding</A> is provided.  Lucas and Jarvis
      provide <A HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html">another
      explanation</A> on their website.</LI>

    <LI>Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an
    appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test
    is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple
    inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.</LI>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 27: Tuesday, April 28.</FONT></h4>

<P>Required reading: Richard Karp's 1972 paper, <i>Reducibility Among
Combinatorial Problems</i>, available on Moodle. Obviously, you're not
expected to understand all details of this paper. Here's what you
should do to prepare for our discussion:
<ol>
  <li>Skim the whole paper, skipping over any technical definitions
  and formulas, just to get a feel for what is there.
  <li>Read pages 94-97 a bit more carefully, but still skipping over
  anything that seems tricky.
  <li>Choose 2 or 3 problems from the list of 21 problems on pages
  94-96. (Include at least one problem that we have not discussed in
  class.)  For each of your chosen problems, make sure you understand
  Karp's description of the problem.
  <li>Choose 1 reduction from the 20 reductions in the proof of the
  main theorem, pages 97-100.  (Don't choose one of the ones we have
  proved in class.) Understand the reduction to the best of your
  ability, and make some brief notes so that you can present an
  explanation of the reduction to the rest of the class. If there are
  some parts of the reduction you can't understand, that's OK -- just
  make a careful note of anything you don't understand, and include a
  description of this in your presentation plan.
</ol>

<P>Update, 4:30pm 4/27/15: Chapter 17 of the textbook is now available
on Moodle. Given the late availability, this can be considered
optional reading. But it will probably help you to understand one or
two of Karp's reductions mentioned above, so I do recommend you take a
look at it either before class or after class.

<!-- Required reading: Linz 1.2.   -->

<!-- <P>Note the definition of "language" given near the bottom of page -->
<!-- 18.  The lecture will emphasize two different views of what a -->
<!-- "language" can mean to a computer scientist: 1. a programming -->
<!-- language, and 2. the answer to a mathematical problem (more -->
<!-- specifically, a list of numbers that satisfy some given property, -->
<!-- such as being prime or being even). -->

<!-- <P>We will be using the following five languages as running examples -->
<!-- throughout the course: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--     <li><b>Java programs</b>, written in ASCII -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>an ASCII string is in the language if it can be compiled -->
<!-- 	by the Java compiler with no errors -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>HTML pages</b>, written in ASCII -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>an ASCII string is in the language if it is accepted by -->
<!-- 	the HTML validator -->
<!-- 	at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>. (Example -->
<!-- 	of page with an	error: <a href="deliberate-error.html">deliberate-error.html</a>) -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>multiples of 5</b>, written in decimal -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>a string of decimal digits is in the language if it -->
<!-- 	represents an integer that is a multiple of five -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>prime numbers</b>, written in decimal -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>a string of decimal digits is in the language if it -->
<!-- 	represents an integer that is a prime number -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li><b>Java programs that can't crash</b> (i.e. throw a runtime exception) -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>an ASCII string is in the language if it can be compiled -->
<!-- 	by the Java compiler with no errors, and the resulting program -->
<!-- 	will never throw a runtime exception, no matter what input it -->
<!-- 	receives. -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--       </ol> -->
<!-- The main question is: what type of computers (i.e. automata) -->

<!-- <P>Mini-lab to understand basics about grammars: -->
<!--   <UL> -->
<!--     <LI>fire up JFLAP.  Click on grammar.  Create your own grammar.  (Use S as the start symbol. Use uppercase letters as variables, lowercase letters as terminal symbols.) </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Choose "multiple brute force parse".  In the frame on the right, in the input column, enter a string you believe is in the language defined by your grammar.  Click "run inputs" and check that "accept" is the result.  </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Now click "start" in the top-left frame.  Click "step" a few times.  Switch between inverted tree and derivation table, try to understand what is being shown here.  </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Step through the derivation of another string that is in your language; this time ensure the string has length at least 4.  </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Find a string that is not in your language; make sure that the result is "reject".  Find several more strings that get rejected.  </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Find the three shortest strings that are accepted. Find the three shortest strings that are rejected.</LI> -->

<!-- <\!-- <P>The lecture will briefly mention some of the material in Linz -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 1.3, but this section is not required reading. -\-> -->

<!-- <P>Mini-lab using JFLAP to investigate -->
<!-- some rudimentary dfas: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>In JFLAP, create a dfa that accepts strings of one or more 'a's, optionally preceded by a single 'b'. -->
<!--   <li>Test your dfa using "multiple run". -->
<!--   <li>Does your dfa have transitions for every possible input?  If -->
<!--   not, it is incomplete, according to the definition given in our -->
<!--   textbook, but JFLAP allows this kind of incomplete dfa.  What is the -->
<!--   interpretation of a missing transition? -->
<!--   <li>If your dfa is complete, delete a few transitions to make it -->
<!--   incomplete.  Now use the "add trap state" functionality to complete -->
<!--   it. -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 5: Tuesday, February 7</FONT></h4> -->

<!-- Required reading: Linz 2.2. -->

<!-- <P><b>A note on nondeterminism:</b> Nondeterminism does not exist in -->
<!-- any real computer. It is a theoretical concept that we introduce for -->
<!-- <i>convenience</i>, because it is often much easier to prove facts -->
<!-- about nondeterministic automata, compared to deterministic automata. -->
<!-- There are two useful ways to think about nondeterminism: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>Imagine a computer with supernatural powers that can examine -->
<!--   multiple possibilities at the same time. For example, consider a -->
<!--   supernatural chess computer that could simultaneously analyze the -->
<!--   consequences of 10 different possible moves.  Instead of having to -->
<!--   make a -->
<!--   <i>deterministic</i> choice about which of the 10 moves to analyze, -->
<!--   this computer can make a <i>nondeterministic</i> choice to analyze -->
<!--   all 10 moves at once! -->
<!--   <li>It is always possible to simulate nondeterminism on a real -->
<!--   computer, in the following way. Whenever a (supernatural) computer -->
<!--   wants to make a nondeterministic choice, we just make a list of the -->
<!--   possible choices available, and store them in a queue in our (real) -->
<!--   computer's memory.  Then, analyze each of the choices one at time. -->
<!--   If further nondeterministic choices are encountered, add them to the -->
<!--   queue and analyze them later too. -->
<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- <P>JFLAP mini-lab to investigate -->
<!-- non-determinism: -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>In JFLAP, implement an nfa that accepts the language: {<i>aaa</i> or an -->
<!--   even number of <i>a</i>'s} -->
<!--   <li>Use the "step with closure" option to see how the nfa processes -->
<!--   the following two strings: <i>aaaaa</i>, and <i>aaaa</i>.  You will -->
<!--   repeatedly click on the "step" button to do this. Once you -->
<!--   understand the effect of the "step" button, investigate the effect -->
<!--   of the other buttons (reset, freeze, thaw, trace, and remove). -->
<!--   <li>Now practice using nondeterminism that arises from transitions -->
<!--   on the empty string. Implement an nfa for the language -->
<!--   {<i>aaaa</i>, <i>aaaba</i>}, using at least one transition on the -->
<!--   empty string.  Use "step with closure" to investigate the workings -->
<!--   of this nfa. -->
<!--   <li>Add more nondeterminism to your nfa.  Practice stepping through -->
<!--   sets of states, freezing and/or removing some of them. -->
<!-- </ol> -->


<!-- <h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6: Thursday, February 10</FONT></h4> -->

<!-- Required reading: Linz 2.3. -->

<!-- <P>We will do two JFLAP mini-labs to practice converting between nfas -->
<!-- and dfas, based on examples from Linz. JFLAP files for these Linz -->
<!-- examples are available: -->
<!-- <A HREF="fig2.12.jff">fig2.12.jff</A>, and <A -->
<!-- HREF="fig2.14.jff">fig2.14.jff</A>. -->

<!-- <P>Important hints for using JFLAP to convert from an nfa to a dfa: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>Typically, you will only use the second tool, labeled "expand -->
<!--   group on terminal".  To use this tool, always click on an existing -->
<!--   state that needs a new transition, drag away from that state, and -->
<!--   release. -->
<!--   <li>The other tools can be used to skip some steps and complete the -->
<!--   conversion more quickly, but they won't help you to learn the -->

<!--   <li>JFLAP doesn't let you insert trap states during the conversion -->
<!--   from nfa to dfa, so you can ignore transitions that end in the empty -->
<!--   set of states.  Once the conversion is complete, use the "add trap -->
<!--   state" functionality to obtain a complete dfa. -->

<!--   online <a href="http://www.jflap.org/tutorial/">JFLAP tutorial</a> -->
<!--   (click on "Finite Automata", then "Convert to DFA"). -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <P>Optional extension to this minilab: play around with the "minimize -->
<!-- dfa" functionality. One very interesting example is the one we tried -->
<!-- in Class 5: first create an nfa for the language on {a,b} that accepts -->
<!-- any string containing "aaaba".  Now convert that nfa to a dfa.  Now -->
<!-- minimize the resulting dfa.  Do you get the same results we got by -->
<!-- hand? -->
