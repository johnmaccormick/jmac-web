    The vast majority of information for this course can be found on the <A HREF="../../index.html">main COMP131 web page</A>.  This page contains only information specific to <I>section 1</I> of the course, instructed by John MacCormick.<P>

<p><b>Late submissions of homework and labs</b>: Each student is
permitted a total of two no-penalty days of lateness over the entire
semester; every subsequent day of lateness incurs a 25% penalty for
the late assignment.

<p><b>Conditions for in-class written exams</b>: Each
in-class exam is 50 minutes long.  Each student may
bring into the exam a single sheet of standard
letter-sized paper containing <I>hand-written</I> notes
(both sides of the sheet may be used).  Apart from this
single sheet of paper, no notes or materials of any kind
may be consulted during the exam.  In addition, no
electronic devices of any kind, including calculators or
cell phones, may be used.  It is highly advisable to
include reasoning or working in all exam answers, as
partial credit for incorrect answers can only be given
if your working demonstrates a correct understanding of
the concepts being examined.
