    The vast majority of information for this course can be found on the <A HREF="../../index.html">main COMP131 web page</A>.  This page contains only information specific to <I>section 2</I> of the course, taught by Nathan Vaillette.<P>

<p><b>Late submissions of homework and labs</b>: In general, late
homework and lab assignments will not be accepted, i.e. they will be
graded as a zero.  However, I will be forgiving if you hand <i>one</i>
assigmnent in one or two days late.  Any subsequent late submissions will be graded as a zero.


<p><b>Conditions for in-class written exams</b>: Each
in-class exam is 50 minutes long.  Each student may
bring into the exam a single sheet of standard
letter-sized paper containing <I>hand-written</I> notes
(both sides of the sheet may be used).  Apart from this
single sheet of paper, no notes or materials of any kind
may be consulted during the exam.  In addition, no
electronic devices of any kind, including calculators or
cell phones, may be used.  It is highly advisable to
include reasoning or working in all exam answers, as
partial credit for incorrect answers can only be given
if your working demonstrates a correct understanding of
the concepts being examined.
