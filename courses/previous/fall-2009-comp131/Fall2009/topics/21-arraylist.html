<p>
</p><ol>
<LI>Fill in the body of the <code>printDVDTitle</code> method in the <code>VideoStore</code> class.

<li>Draw the object diagram that would result from the following sequence of operations performed using the <i>VideoStore</i> project. See sections 4.6 and 4.7 in the text for an example.
<OL>
<LI>Create a <code>VideoStore</code> object named <code>moVid</code> with the store name "Moe's Video".
<LI>Create a <code>DVD</code> object for the R rated movie Spinal Tap that can be rented for 3 days.
<LI>Add the "Spinal Tap" <code>DVD</code> to the collection.
<LI>Create a <code>DVD</code> object for the G rated movie Bambi that can be rented for 2 days.
<LI>Add the "Bambi" <code>DVD</code> to the collection.
</OL></li>

<LI>How would you remove the "Spinal Tap" <code>DVD</code> from the collection? How would this change your object diagram? (You don't have to redraw it, just describe the change.)</LI>

<li>Do Exercises 4.2-4.9 in Barnes &amp; Kolling</li>

<h3>Homework Assignment 7a</h3>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Give a line of code using the <code>new</code> operator to perform the following operations:
<OL type='a'>
<LI>Declare a variable named <code>myList</code> and set it to hold a reference to a new <code>ArrayList</code> of references <code>DVD</code> objects. 
<LI>Declare a variable named <code>myBestCoin</code> and set it to hold a reference to a new <code>Coin</code> object representing a mint condition, 1810, Silver dollar that is worth $225.50. (You will need to use the Coin constructor from the <a href="../examples/CoinCollection.zip"><i>CoinCollection</i></a> project for this.)
<LI>Declare a variable named <code>myFavDVD</code> and set it to hold a reference to a new <code>DVD</code> object representing the "R" rated "Terminator" DVD that can be rented for 5 nights.
</OL>


<LI>Download and unpack the 
<a href="../examples/CoinCollection.zip"><i>CoinCollection</i></a> project. Complete the implementation of the <code>CoinCollection</code> class according to the specifications contained in its javadoc documentation (look at the Documentation view in BlueJ). Save this project. You will be adding to it in the next several homework assignments.  Once all of the assignments are complete, you will submit your project via Web-CAT.


<li>Draw the object diagram that would result from the following sequence of operations performed using the <i>CoinCollection</i> project from the text. See sections 4.6 and 4.7 in the text for an example of an object diagram.
<OL type='a'>
<LI>Create a <code>CoinCollection</code> object named <code>myColl</code> with the collection name being "Loose Change".
<LI>Add a <code>Coin</code> named <code>coin1</code> representing a good condition, 1932, penny that is worth $2.50.
<LI>Add a <code>Coin</code> named <code>coin2</code> representing a poor condition, 1850, nickel that is worth $12.75.
<LI>Add a <code>Coin</code> named <code>coin3</code> representing a mint condition, 1790, quarter that is worth $135.00.
</OL>

<LI>How would you remove the 1850 nickel from the <code>MyCoins</code> collection? How would this change your object diagram? (You don't have to redraw it, just describe the change.)</LI>
</ol>
