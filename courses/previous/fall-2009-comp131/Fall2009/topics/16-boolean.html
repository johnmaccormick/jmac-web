<ol>
<li> Implement the <code>has30Days</code> method in the <code>Date</code> class
of the <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project.  Also create test methods that achieve
statement coverage for your implementation.
<li>Do you think statement coverage provides sufficient testing for your <code>has30Days</code>
method? Why or why not?
<li> Rewrite the code for the <code>isLeap</code> method in the <code>Date</code> class 
of the <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project using the Boolean operators.  You should be able to 
produce a significantly simpler version now.  To help, here is a summary of the rules:
<UL>
<LI>If the year is before 1384 and it is divisible by 4 it is a leap year.
<LI>Otherwise the year is a leap year if...
<UL>
<LI>It is divisible by 4, <LI>as long as it is not divisible by 100, <LI>unless it is also divisible by 400.
</UL>
</UL>

<li>Do the tests you created for the previous version of the <code>isLeap</code> method 
still achieve statement coverage?

<!--
<li> The constructor for the <code>Date</code> class in the 
 <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project does not check that its parameters make
 sense.  For example, the day must be between 1 and 31, and the month 
 must be one of January, February, ..., December.  Modify the constructor
 so that it checks these conditions, and prints an error message if any
 parameter is invalid.  You can assume that every month has exactly
 31 days.  Additionally, create a test class and
 write test cases that achieve statement coverage for
 your modified constructor.  Note that you may
 need to add additional methods to the class in order to test
 the constructor properly.
-->

<li> Consider the boolean expression: <code>(x &lt; 3) || (x &gt; 4)</code>.
   What values of <code>x</code> make this expression
 true?  Justify your answer.
<li> Consider the boolean expression: <code>(x &lt; 15) &amp;&amp; (x &gt; 4)</code>.
   What values of <code>x</code> make this expression
 false?  Justify your answer.
<li> Consider the boolean expression: <code>!((x &lt; 3) &amp;&amp; (x &gt; 4))</code>.
   What values of <code>x</code> make this expression
 true?  Justify your answer.


<li> Will the <code>grade</code> method from the <code>GradeCalculator</code>
 class of the <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project
 still work correctly if the order of the ifs (and the corresponding
 code) is changed?  For example, if the method body is changed to:
<pre>
        if (pct &gt;= 90 &amp;&amp; pct &lt;= 100) {
            letGrade = "A";
        } else if (pct &gt;= 70 &amp;&amp; pct &lt; 80) {
            letGrade = "C";
        } else if (pct &gt;= 80 &amp;&amp; pct &lt; 90) {
            letGrade = "B";
        } else {
            letGrade = "other";
        }
</pre>
 Why or why not?

<!--
<li> Do the test cases that you developed for the <code>max3</code>
 method (class <code>FindMax</code>) as implemented in the <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project 
 still achieve statement coverage
 for the <code>max3</code> method (still class <code>FindMax</code>)
 as implemented in the <i>IfExamples-v2</i> project?
 Why or why not?

<H3>Homework Assignment 5c</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Consider the boolean expression: 
 <code>(x &lt; 10) &amp;&amp; (x &gt; 4)</code>.
   What values of <code>x</code> make this expression
 false?  Justify your answer.
<li> Consider the boolean expression: 
 <code>!(x &lt; 10)</code>.
  What values of <code>x</code> make this expression
 true?  Justify your answer.
<li> Consider the boolean expression: 
 <code>(year % 400 == 0) &amp;&amp; (year % 100 != 0)</code>. 
  What values of <code>year</code> make this expression
 true?  Justify your answer.

<li> Download and unzip the <i>GuessingGame</i> project, and edit the
 class <code>Game</code> within that project.  
 When finished, this class will allow two people to play everyone's
 favorite guessing game - "I'm thinking of a number betweem 1 and 10."
 One player will use the constructor for the class to create a new
 <code>Game</code> object containing the number they are thinking of.  The 
 second player will repeatedly call a method called <code>guess</code>
 to attempt to guess the number.
<p>
 You must implement this constructor and method as follows:
<ul>
<li> the constructor must take one parameter - the number that the
 first player is thinking of
<li> the <code>guess</code> method must also take one parameter - the
 number that the second player is guessing.  The method must then 
 respond by returning one of the following messages:
  <ul>
  <li> "Your guess is out of range!" if the guess is not between 1 and 10
  <li> "You win!" if the guess is correct
  <li> "Your guess is too high!" if the guess is too high
  <li> "Your guess is too low!" if the guess is too low
  </ul>
</ul>
 Stub versions of the constructor and <code>guess</code> method are
 provided for you, so you need only fill in the code in the bodies of
 these methods.
<p>
 You must also provide test cases for the 
 <code>guess</code> method that achieve statement coverage.
<p>
Submit this project via WebCAT.  Note that WebCAT will not accept your
submission if you have not created a test class for class <code>Game</code>.
