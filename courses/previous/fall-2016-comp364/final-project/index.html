    <H2>COMP364 Final Project</H2>

    <H3>Introduction</H3>


The objective of the final project is to implement, write up, and
present an AI-related experiment involving creativity, research,
experimentation, and programming.  Students must work in teams of one,
two, or three people.  Any suitable AI-related topic may be selected
for the project.  A number of suggested topics are provided below, but
other topics are also possible -- please consult with the instructor
to ensure the suitability of your choice of topic.  The main
requirements for a good topic are: (i) it provides potential for
substantial programming, and (ii) it provides potential for conducting
interesting experiments.

<P>A substantial fraction of class time for the final two weeks of the
semester will involve work on the final project. There will be no
other homework assignments during this time. Students will present the
results of their projects in the final exam slot.  Thus, the project
should represent three weeks of work for this course, or (very
roughly) 25-30 hours of work.

<H3>Grading</H3>


Grading will be as follows:
<UL>
  <LI>Code (45 points): The project must involve a substantial
  programming component.  Any programming language may be used. The
  programming may build on an existing code base from a previous
  assignment or downloaded from any suitable source. Code written
  for the final project should be clearly marked using comments that
  contain the string "final project".  Although the amount of code
  written will vary considerably between projects, this part of the
  project should represent 10-15 hours' work, which would typically
  translate into a few hundred lines of code.  Code will be graded
  on the same criteria as the programming assignments in this
  course, as listed on the course web pages.

<LI>Written report (45 points): The objectives, methods, and results
of the project should be described in a formal written report. The
overall style of the report should be that of a scientific
publication, such as the ones we have studied in this course.  The
audience of the report should be the instructor and other students
in the course. Thus, notions covered in the course may be assumed
without definition, but other concepts should be carefully described
in the report.  As with any college-level writing, suitable
citations should be used wherever appropriate, and a complete
bibliography must be included.  Any suitable structure for the
document may be used. One possible structure is to use the following
section headings: <UL>
  <LI>Introduction: describe the goals your project and any context or background  required.
  <LI>Methods: describe the design of your code and your experiments.
  <LI>Results: describes the results of your experiments, including
  tables and charts if appropriate.
  <LI>Conclusions: summarize what you learned from the experiments; optionally, discuss alternative approaches and further work that could be done.
  <LI>Bibliography: list the sources used.
</UL>

Any reasonable spacing and formatting conventions may be used. The
suggested length of the report is 5-10 pages, but longer reports
will not be penalized.

<P>At the end of your report, please add a short appendix (2-3
sentences should be sufficient) describing the contributions of each
team member to the project. The purpose of this appendix is to provide
evidence that each team member has made a reasonable level of
contribution to the project.  Usually, each team member will receive
the same grade for the project.

<P>The report will be graded on the usual
characteristics for writing (clarity, correctness of spelling and
grammar, completeness in addressing the above requirements, logical
structure), together with the overall intellectual merit of the
project.

<LI>Presentation (10 points): In the final exam slot, the project
and its results must be described in a presentation of approximately
10 minutes' duration (presentations shorter than 7 minutes or longer
than 15 minutes will be penalized).  A <A HREF="presentation-rubric.pdf">rubric</A> for this presentation
is provided; it is very similar to the rubric for the paper
presentation earlier in the semester.

</UL>

<H3>Milestones</H3>


<P> The project consists of three milestones: FP1, FP2, and FP3. FP1
and FP2 are ungraded, but are designed to assist with keeping the
project on track. FP3 consists of the submission of code, report,
and giving the presentation in the final exam slot.  Specifics of the milestones are as follows:
<UL>
  <LI>FP1: Submit to Moodle a 100-300 word paragraph describing:
    <UL>
      <LI>The topic of your project.
      
<LI>A minimal coding milestone that you are
  absolutely sure will be achievable within one week of work,
  <B>and</B>
  will permit some interesting experiments to be conducted and
  written up.  (Obviously, it would be preferable to achieve more
  than your minimal milestone, but the objective here is to ensure
  you have <I>something</I> to write about in your report, since you
  will
  need to start writing the report well in advance of the final
  deadline.)

<LI>A brief description of the proposed experiments that will be
written up.
    </UL>

<LI>FP2: Submit to Moodle a zip file of the code written so far, and
a brief written update describing your progress relative to the
minimal milestone identified in FP1.

<LI>FP3: Submit to Moodle a zip file of all the code you wrote, and
the written report.

</UL>



<H3>Potential project topics</H3>


<P>
Here is a list of potential projects:
<UL>
  <LI>Implement and experiment with one of the memory-limited search
  strategies described in the textbook.
  <LI>Implement A* search with a landmark-based heuristic, and
  compare performance with other search algorithms using real road
  data.
  <LI>Further improve your Othello player using one or more of the
  additional tricks mentioned in the textbook (quiescence, forward
  pruning, beam search, ProbCut, adding a database of openings
  and/or endgames).
  <LI>Implement expectiminimax for a simple stochastic game and
  investigate the performance of various evaluation functions,
  including one based on Monte Carlo simulation.
  <UL>
    <LI>Note: For this project and the next one, here is one simple
    two-player
    stochastic game that might be suitable for analysis.  The game, which we'll call <I>Monopole</I>,
    is played on a board with 20 locations in a circuit (think
    Monopoly).  Both players begin on the designated start
    location. Every time you pass the start square, you receive
    $200 from the other player (similar to, but not the same as,
    Monopoly).  At each turn, you may choose to remain where you
    are, or to move by rolling two 6-sided dice. If you choose to
    move, you roll the dice and move forward by the number of
    locations which is the
    sum of the two dice.  However, if you end up on the same
    location as the other player, you must immediately pay that
    player $1000.  The game ends after each player has had 10 turns.
  </UL>
  <LI>[Adapted from textbook exercise 5.17] Implement expectiminimax
  and *-alpha-beta (as described by
  Ballard (1983) -- see the textbook bibliography) for a simple
  stochastic game; compare their performance and analyze how well
  the pruning works.
  <LI>Implement simulated annealing and/or a genetic algorithm on
  one or more interesting problems (for
  example, image denoising, traveling salesman) and conduct
  experiments on their effectiveness.  See textbook exercises 4.3
  and 4.4 for more specific ideas.
  <LI>Tackle one of the projects suggested in Section 10 of the
  document describing the Clue programming assignment: counting
  cards, a DPLL implementation, or a stochastic local search
  implementation.
  <LI>Extend your decision tree implementation from programming
  assignment 4 to handle missing data and numeric data, and
  implement some version of pruning. Conduct experiments to
  determine whether pruning improves the performance of the tree
  and if so by how much.
  <LI>Implement the back-propagation learning algorithm for a simple
    neural network, and conduct experiments to determine its efficacy.
  <LI>Experiment with Bayesian networks or some other machine learning
  tool, taking as your starting point an existing toolbox such as
  Weka.
  <LI>Use one of the topics from our paper presentations earlier in
  the semester as your starting point. Implement a simplified or
  altered version of the technique proposed in the paper, and conduct
  experiments on it. For example, do you agree with the authors'
  conclusions? Or, were you able to reproduce the authors' results?
  Why/why not?

</UL>

<H3>Final remarks</H3>

Your project should not have significant overlap with any other work
done at Dickinson. Late days may not be used for the presentation,
but may be used for the code and written report submissions.
