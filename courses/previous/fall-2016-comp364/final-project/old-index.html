    <H1>COMP364 Final Project</H1>


Here is an evolving list of potential projects:
<UL>
  <LI>Implement A* search with a landmark-based heuristic, and
  compare performance with other search algorithms using real road
  data.
  <LI>Further improve your Othello player using one or more of the
  additional tricks mentioned in the textbook (quiescence, forward
  pruning, beam search, ProbCut, adding a database of openings
  and/or endgames).
  <LI>Implement expectiminimax for a simple stochastic game and
  investigate the performance of various evaluation functions,
  including one based on Monte Carlo simulation.
  <UL>
    <LI>Note: For this project and the next one, here is one simple
    two-player
    stochastic game that might be suitable for analysis.  The game, which we'll call <I>Monopole</I>,
    is played on a board with 20 locations in a circuit (think
    Monopoly).  Both players begin on the designated start
    location. Every time you pass the start square, you receive
    $200 from the other player (similar to, but not the same as,
    Monopoly).  At each turn, you may choose to remain where you
    are, or to move by rolling two 6-sided dice. If you choose to
    move, you roll the dice and move forward by the number of
    locations which is the
    sum of the two dice.  However, if you end up on the same
    location as the other player, you must immediately pay that
    player $1000.  The game ends after each player has had 10 turns.
  </UL>
  <LI>[Adapted from textbook exercise 5.17] Implement expectiminimax
  and *-alpha-beta (as described by
  Ballard (1983) -- see the textbook bibliography) for a simple
  stochastic game; compare their performance and analyze how well
  the pruning works.
  <LI>Implement simulated annealing and/or a genetic algorithm on
  one or more interesting problems (for
  example, image denoising, traveling salesman) and conduct
  experiments on their effectiveness.  See textbook exercises 4.3
  and 4.4 for more specific ideas.
  <LI>Tackle one of the projects suggested in Section 10 of the
  document describing the Clue programming assignment: counting
  cards, a DPLL implementation, or a stochastic local search
  implementation.
  <LI>Extend your decision tree implementation from programming
  assignment 4 to handle missing data and numeric data, and
  implement some version of pruning. Conduct experiments to
  determine whether pruning improves the performance of the tree
  and if so by how much.
  <LI>Implement the back-propagation learning algorithm for a simple
  neural network, and conduct experiments to determine its efficacy.
