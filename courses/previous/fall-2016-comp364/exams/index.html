    <H2>COMP364 Exams</H2>

    <P>As stated on the syllabus: "Exams are open note. Students may
    consult any printed or handwritten materials brought into the exam
    and any static content stored locally on the student's own device
    or on a Dickinson College server. Web searches are not permitted.
    No content stored outside the College network may be
    consulted. Electronic devices may only be used for browsing static
    content (i.e. devices may not be used to perform any other type of
    computation), unless specifically permitted in the exam
    instructions. A majority of exam questions will be similar to the
    sample exam questions provided on the course webpages.  These
    sample exam questions should be regarded as compulsory but
    ungraded homework, to be done immediately after the class in which
    they are provided."

<P>Therefore, the best way to prepare for an exam is to ensure that
you can effortlessly answer the sample exam questions.  Note that
solutions to all sample questions are provided on Moodle.

<P>Exams will be 75 minutes in length.
