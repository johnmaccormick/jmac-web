<hr><h3>Writing Assignment 1</h3>

In this assignment, you will write an essay explaining your own,
personal answer to the question "Can machines think?"  Although the
assignment asks for your own opinion on this question, you must
clearly demonstrate that your opinion is <I>informed</I> by the
readings from this course -- even if you disagree with some or all
of those readings.  The main content of your essay should be a clear
statement of your answer to the above question, one or more
paragraphs justifying this answer, and one or more
paragraphs addressing objections to your answer.

<P> The audience for your essay is your classmates: people who have
read and thought a little about the philosophy of artificial
intelligence, but are not experts in the area.  Thus, your essay
should have a formal, academic tone, but need not give detailed
explanations of concepts covered in our discussions.

<P> Because this is our first writing assignment, some very specific
requirements will be imposed to ensure you are acquiring the
necessary techniques for college-level writing.  Specifically, your
essay must

<UL>

<LI>italicize the thesis statement (see WR, C2-a);</LI>

<LI>italicize the topic sentence of each paragraph (see WR, C4-a)
(exception: if,
  for stylistic reasons, a paragraph does not have a topic sentence,
  insert the phrase "[No topic sentence]" at the start of that
  paragraph);</LI> 

<LI>contain at least four cited, direct quotes from class readings
(see WR, APA-2b);</LI>

<LI>contain at least four cited paraphrases from class readings (see
WR, APA-2c);</LI>

<LI>use an ellipsis in a direct quotation at least once (see WR,
APA-3a);</LI>

<LI>use brackets in a direct quotation at least once (see WR,
APA-3a);</LI>

<LI>use a long, indented quotation at least once (see WR,
APA-3a).</LI>

</UL>

<P> The grading scheme for this assignment will be: 20&#37; for the
specific requirements listed above (italicizing thesis statement,
topic sentences, and including quotations), and 80&#37; for the
style and content of the essay. The 80&#37; for style and content
will be assessed by awarding points in the following five
categories: thesis statement; logical argument; clear, concise
language; audience; critical analysis.



<P> For this assignment, you are not required or expected to do
research beyond the class readings.  It is of course permissible to
use other material (which must be correctly cited if used), but the
maximum grade can be achieved by using only class readings.  Future
assignments will require citations from sources other than the class
readings.

<P> As stated in the syllabus, the essay must be between 2000 and
2500 words, including the bibliography in APA style.


<hr><h3>Writing Assignment 2</h3>

The central task in Writing Assignment 2 is to revise and improve
your essay from Writing Assignment 1.  To demonstrate the revision
process, you are recquired to submit three separate documents for
this assignment:

<DL>
  <DT><B>1. List of technical fixes</B> (5% of grade)</DT>
  <DD><P>In the feedback provided for Writing Assignment 1, there
  was a
  section called "technical writing issues".  This consisted of a
  list of specific technical problems which you must locate and fix.
  Sometimes the problem occurred more than once and this repitition
  is indicated in
  parentheses. For example, "misused quotation marks (III)" means
  that quotation marks were misused three times. Sometimes, the
  appropriate section of <I>A Writer's Reference</I> is indicated to
  help you understand the error. For example, "misused quotation
  marks (WR, P6-g)" means you should consult section P6-g of <I>A
  Writer's Reference</I>.  <P> In your list of technical fixes, you
  must list each of these identified technical writing issues,
  together with the original sentence in which the problem occurred,
  and a new sentence (or perhaps sentences) that fix the problem.
  For problems that occurred multiple times, you must provide the
  corresponding number of fixes.  If the problem was described as
  "numerous", find and correct at least three instances.
  Please follow the formatting from the <A
  HREF="resources/techincal-issues-example.pdf">example
  provided</A>, and list
  your fixes in exactly the same order that they occurred in the
  feedback.<P></DD> 


  <DT><B>2. Description of revisions</B> (5% of grade)</DT>
  <DD><P>Write a paragraph of between 100 and 300 words describing the
  revisions you have performed on your original essay.  Do not list
  grammatical or technical changes (such as those in document 1
  above).  Rather, describe any changes you made to your thesis or
  the structure of your essay, any additions of new material or
  deletions of old material, and any other significant changes.  Pay
  particular attention to describing how you addressed any concerns
  they were raised in the feedback from the first writing
  assignment.<P></DD>


  <DT><B>3. Revised essay</B> (90% of grade)</DT>
  <DD><P>This document is a revised version of your essay for
  Assignment 1.  The question to be answered is the same as for
  Assignment 1, as is the audience and other details of the
  assignment.  The only major difference is that the word limit has
  been
  altered: as stated in the syllabus, your essay for Assignment 2
  must be between 2000 and 3000 words. (That is, the minimum word
  count is the same as for Assignment 1, but the maximum word count
  has been increased from 2500 to 3000.)  Another difference is that
  the various specific requirements about italicizing certain
  sentences and including certain types of quotations will no longer
  be enforced.  As with Assignment 1, there is no requirement to use
  sources outside the class readings.

  <P>The grade for this essay will depend in part on the absolute
  quality of the work but will also be strongly affected by the
  quality of your revisions. For example, an essay that received an
  A on Assignment 1 will receive a much lower grade on Assignment 2
  unless it has been enhanced significantly by the revision process.
  If you received a B+ or better on Assignment 1, you
  should strongly consider adding some new material to ensure that
  your revisions produce a significant enhancement.<P>
