    <H2>COMP364 Exams</H2>

<P>As stated on the syllabus: "Exams are open note: any printed,
written, or electronic material may be consulted during an
exam. Electronic devices may be used, unless specifically stated
otherwise. A majority of exam questions will be similar to the sample
exam questions provided on the course webpages.  These sample exam
questions should be regarded as compulsory but ungraded homework, to
be done immediately after the class in which they are provided."

<P>Therefore, the best way to prepare for an exam is to ensure that
you can effortlessly answer the sample exam questions.  Note that
solutions to all sample questions are provided on Moodle.

<P>Exams will be 75 minutes in length.
