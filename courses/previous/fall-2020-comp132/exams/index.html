As stated on the syllabus:
    
<blockquote>
"The midterm and final exams are open note and open web.  Students may
consult any printed or digital materials and may perform web
searches. However, no communication with other humans is permitted...
<P>Technically speaking, any material covered in any lecture, reading,
lab, or homework assignment is eligible to appear in the midterm or
final exams. In practice, most exam questions will be similar to a
homework question, an example done in class, or other assigned
practice questions...
<P>Ample extended time will be available to all students and
  the <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20027/academics/4045/ads_test_related_guidance">ADS
  Test-Related Guidance</a> will be followed."
</blockquote>

<P>Following is some additional clarification of the above syllabus
statements. Students are encouraged to use all appropriate tools,
including Eclipse, web searches, and existing content on programming
websites such as Stack Overflow. However, it is not permitted to
actively seek help from other humans either directly or via an online
forum.

<P>Exams will be provided in Microsoft Word format. Answers can be
provided in any reasonable format, including Microsoft Word, PDF, or
handwritten solutions that have been scanned/photographed.

<P>Students with academic accommodations receive extra time in the
normal way. For example, if the stated time to submit the exam is 24
hours, a student who normally receives time-and-a-half for tests will
have 36 hours to complete the exam.
