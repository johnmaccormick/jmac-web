<P>Am I recording the Zoom meeting? Please remind me if not. Please do
this for every segment of every class. Thank you!

<P>Today will be using the online Java compiler offered by repl.it: <a href="https://repl.it/languages/java10">https://repl.it/languages/java10</a>.

<P>If you haven't already completed the following two Google forms,
please do so now:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://forms.gle/aBFskVzfwEWHr7SB9">GitHub
	username form</a>
	<li><a href="https://forms.gle/nt34uKmefhGoqZp68">Time zone
	and previous experience form</a>
      </ul>

<P>If you haven't already accepted an invitation to join the GitHub
dickinson-comp132 organization, please
visit <a href="https://github.com/dickinson-comp132">https://github.com/dickinson-comp132</a> to accept this invitation now.
      
<P>Note the instructions for installing software or accessing software
  on a Dickinson computer, at the top of our
  course <a href="../how-to.html">how-to page</a>.
      
<P>Introductions and getting to know other students:
  <ol>
    <li>Before Wednesday, please post an introduction of yourself to
our Moodle Discussion forum. I have already introduced myself
there. Your introduction can be of any length (one sentence or more),
but please try to mention at least one interesting thing such as your
favorite TV show/computer game/movie/band/sports team/book so that
others will be able to respond to you meaningfully.
    <li>Before Friday, please post at least two replies to
introductions by other students in the class.
  </ol>
      
<P>Recordings of this class: <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/8de5bbbc-c35a-45cd-bdd7-547a3de6afa9">segment 1</a>, <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/7f6b9c5d-3d8a-435d-897a-20c5ba4cd199">segment 2.</a>

====== under construction =========

<!-- <P>Before we start the course, please complete the following survey -->
<!-- that will help me to improve the targeting of the course in future: -->
<!-- <a href="https://dickinson.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0HABwIcfqc9h5wF">computational -->
<!-- theory pedagogy survey</a>. -->

<!-- <P>The textbook is called <i>What Can Be Computed?</i>, which we -->
<!--     abbreviate as <i>WCBC</i>.   A free electronic copy of WCBC and all of the sample -->
<!--     programs are available on Moodle. -->

<!-- <P>It is recommended, but not required, that you also purchase a -->
<!-- printed copy of WCBC. The cost is $11. To order your printed copy, you -->
<!-- must give $11 to me or to Tonya Miller in the department office -->
<!-- by <i>5PM Thursday, January 26</i>.  Please pay by cash or check to -->
<!-- "Dickinson College". -->
      
<!-- <P>Today we will go through the syllabus and an overview of the course, -->
<!-- corresponding to WCBC Chapter 1. -->

<!-- <P>If there's time, we will try to run and edit some Python programs -->
<!--   using IDLE. Key points: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>Always use Version 3.x of Python for this course -->
<!--   <li>You can download Python 3 and install it on your own laptop etc. -->
<!--   <li>Python is also available on all department iMacs in Tome: -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--       <li>use the search functionality (top right of the desktop) to -->
<!--       open IDLE with Version 3.x of Python -->
<!--       <li>see the <a href="IDLE-screenshot.png">accompanying screenshot</a> if desired -->
<!--       <li>you can ignore any warnings about the version of Tcl/Tk -->
<!--     </ul> -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 2: Thursday, January 26</FONT></h4> -->

<!-- <P>Required reading: Chapters 1 and 2 of WCBC. -->

<!-- <P>Warm-up: use containsGAGA.py to determine whether the -->
<!-- file <a href="CAGT.txt">CAGT.txt</a> contains the string "GAGA". -->

<!-- <P>To download JFLAP, follow the instructions -->
<!-- at <a href="http://jflap.org/">jflap.org</a> (you will be asked to -->
<!-- fill out a short form). The best version for this course -->
<!-- is <tt>JFLAP_Thin.jar</tt> from May 2011. -->
  
<!-- <P>Minilab (ungraded): using JFLAP, -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>experiment with <a href="binary-incrementer.jff">binary-incrementer.jff</a> -->
<!--   <li>Create and test the basic version of LastTtoA (fig 5.3) -->
<!--   <li>Create and test the abbreviated version of LastTtoA (fig 5.6) -->
<!--   <li>Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings, -->
<!--   changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c" -->
<!--   <li>Optional extras: Create a machine that accepts any string of -->
<!--   length 10 or more that also contains an "a". -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6: Thursday, February 9.</FONT></h4> -->

<!-- <P>Required reading: WCBC Chapter 6. -->


<!-- <P>Minilab (ungraded, but important and fun): -->

<!--   <UL> -->

<!--     <LI>Download the -->
<!-- <A -->
<!--     HREF="tu.jff">Universal -->
<!--     Turing machine</A> -->
<!--  of Lucas and Jarvis (see also their <A -->
<!--     HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg0.html">explanatory -->
<!--     webpage</A> if you're interested).</LI> -->


<!--     <LI>Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the -->
<!--       previous class, but using only the alphabet a,b (and blanks). -->
<!--       If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of -->
<!--       <a href="LastBtoA.jff">LastBtoA</a>.  We will use LastBtoA as an -->
<!--       input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine. -->
<!--       <LI>Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas -->
<!--       and Jarvis Universal Turing machine. -->
<!--       An <A HREF="example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf">explanation -->
<!--       of the encoding</A> is provided.  Lucas and Jarvis -->
<!--       provide <A HREF="http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html">another -->
<!--       explanation</A> on their website.</LI> -->

<!--     <LI>Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an -->
<!--     appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test -->
<!--     is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple -->
<!--     inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.</LI> -->

<!-- <P>Optionally, you can gain familiarity with pumping lemma proofs by -->
<!-- playing a game within JFLAP.  Choose "regular pumping lemma" from the -->
<!-- initial JFLAP window. Then choose "computer goes first" (the "you go -->
<!-- first" option is also interesting and useful, but we don't explain it -->
<!-- further here). Choose one of the languages. Now your job is to force -->
<!-- the computer to violate the pumping lemma. JFLAP's notation is as -->
<!-- follows: <i>m</i> is the pumping cutoff; <i>w</i> is the string in the -->
<!-- language that will have some substring pumped; <i>i</i> is the number -->
<!-- of times <i>w</i> will have a substring pumped; <i>w</i> gets -->
<!-- partitioned as <i>w=XYZ</i> where <i>Y</i> is the substring to be -->
<!-- pumped. -->
