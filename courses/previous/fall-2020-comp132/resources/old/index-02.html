our Moodle Discussion forum. I have already introduced myself
there. Your introduction can be of any length (one sentence or more),
but please try to mention at least one interesting thing such as your
favorite TV show/computer game/movie/band/sports team/book so that
others will be able to respond to you meaningfully.

introductions by other students in the class.
