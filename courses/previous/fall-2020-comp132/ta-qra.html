    <h3>Support from Teaching Assistant (TA), Quantitative Reasoning Associate (QRA), Quantitative Reasoning Center, and Computer Science Help Room</h3>

<P>If you have a problem with homework, a lab, or any class material, remember to post your question on our Moodle Discussion forum. Other members of the class may be able to help you.

<P>We are fortunate to have both a Quantitative Reasoning Associate
(QRA) and a Teaching Assistant (TA) supporting us in this course. In
addition, Dickinson's Quantitative Reasoning Center and the
departmental Computer Science Help Room are available to assist
students. Details are as follows.

<ul>
  <li><b>Teaching Assistant:</b> Our TA is Linh Nguyen
    (nguyenlh@dickinson.edu). Linh will assist during lab sessions,
    typically Tuesdays 3-5pm. Linh will also be available in the
    Computer Science Help Room on Sunday evenings, 9:30-11:00pm. (See
    below for more information on the CS Help Room.)
  <li><b>Quantitative Reasoning Associate:</b> Our QRA is Zoe Yin
    (yinz@dickinson.edu). Zoe will be holding QRA office hour sessions
    on Sundays at 7-8pm and Mondays 8-9pm, via Zoom. The Zoom meeting
    details are available on Moodle. Zoe will also be working as a
    tutor in the Quantitative Reasoning Center, 9:00-10:30pm Thursdays
    and Sundays. See below for instructions on signing up for these
    sessions.
  <li><b>Quantitative Reasoning Center:</b> Dickinson College provides
  additional support for students taking courses with quantitative
  content across the curriculum through
  the <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20525/quantitative_reasoning_center/2962/quantitative_reasoning_center">Quantitative
  Reasoning (QR) Center</a>. For the fall 2020 semester, the QR Center
  will offer remote tutoring for COMP132 in addition to general
  quantitative support. It is strongly recommended to make an
  appointment, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Please use <a href="https://dickinson.mywconline.com/">WCONLINE</a> to make an appointment.
  <li>Access the drop-down menu under "limit to" at the top of the scheduler and select COMP132. This will restrict the tutor list and schedule to only those tutors approved for this course.
  <li>When you make your appointment, please also paste or upload your assignment and any work that you have done.
</ul>
  <li><b>Computer Science Help Room:</b> The computer science program
  runs a Help Room staffed by TAs in the evenings, from Sunday to
  Thursday, 8-11 PM, beginning on the Sunday after the first week of
  classes. <a href="https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=935505">Details of how to access the Help Room remotely</a> are available on Moodle.
</ul>
<P>The following table attempts to summarize all of the above, and
adds in the instructor's office hours. In this table, "QRC" means
there is a QR Center tutor qualified for COMP132 scheduled; "CSHR" means Computer Science Help Room, and "JM" means the instructor's office hours.
