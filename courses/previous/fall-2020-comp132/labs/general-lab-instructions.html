<h3>Lab teams and who should submit</h3>
      
<P>Most labs will be done in teams of two. Details of the lab teams
  are available on a separate <a href="lab-teams.html">lab teams
  webpage</a>. On the lab teams webpage, every team will have a single
  member who is designated as the <i>submitter</i> for that lab. The
  instructor will grade only the work submitted by the submitter. All
  members of the team will receive the same grade.

<P>You may work with your lab partner in any way that you find most
productive. Most likely, this is best done via a Zoom meeting or a
Microsoft Teams meeting, in which you share the screen so that both
team members can discuss the Java source code. Other useful tips for
working with a lab partner are available on the
course <a href="../how-to.html">how-to page</a>: see the sections
"Finding your source files to share with a lab partner" and
"Submitting lab report, including self-assessment report, to Moodle".

<P>During a lab session, the instructor will sometimes hold an initial
meeting of the whole class via Zoom, to explain any necessary details
about the lab. After this initial meeting, lab teams will work
separately using whatever method they prefer, but they should be
signed into the Microsoft
Teams <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a13f934d78a6f40e6809431333e9e6b88%40thread.tacv2/Labs?groupId=6cac58dc-a237-476c-93bf-9d2886d29a12&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb">Labs
channel</a>. During the lab session, teams can request help from the
instructor or TA as described next.
  
<h3>Requesting help during a lab session</h3>
	
<P>During a lab session, both the instructor (John MacCormick) and the
teaching assistant (Linh Nguyen) are available to help you with any
aspect of the lab. Details for requesting help are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>To request help, please use
the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a13f934d78a6f40e6809431333e9e6b88%40thread.tacv2/Labs?groupId=6cac58dc-a237-476c-93bf-9d2886d29a12&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb">Labs
channel</a> in Microsoft Teams (this channel is within a Team called
"COMP132 fall 2020"). You can download the Microsoft Teams application
from
the <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/613/gateway_home">Dickinson
gateway</a>: select Office365, then Teams. You can also use Microsoft
Teams within a web browser.
    <li>When requesting help in
the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a13f934d78a6f40e6809431333e9e6b88%40thread.tacv2/Labs?groupId=6cac58dc-a237-476c-93bf-9d2886d29a12&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb">Labs
channel</a>, make sure to "&#64;-mention" the instructor, the TA or
both. You can &#64;-mention someone by first typing the &#64;
character, then begin typing their name, e.g. "&#64;John" or
"&#64;Linh". A small pop-up will appear, specifying the person you
      want. Click on this pop-up and your &#64;-mention is complete.
    <li>When you request help, include a brief description of the
    problem you're having.
    <li>Usually, request help from both the TA and the
    instructor. Whichever one of us becomes available first will
    respond and assist you. However, if you have already been working
    with a specific person, it may be preferable to request help from
    that person only. Feel free to use your own judgment.
</ul>
