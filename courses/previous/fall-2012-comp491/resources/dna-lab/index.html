    <H2>Instructions for DNA lab</H2>

    <H4>Background</H4>

You will be implementing a simple simulator for DNA splicing, using
the test-first software engineering methodology.  Don't worry about
the scientific details of DNA splicing.  For us, a strand of DNA is
modeled by a Java <TT>String</TT> consisting of the characters
C,G,T, and A (repeated any number of times in any order).  When
implementing the splicing methods in the interface
<TT>IDnaStrand</TT>, read the JavaDoc carefully, and implement the
method to the best of your ability, but you can just ignore any
details that you find confusing.  The real point of this lab is the
test-first methodology, not the science of DNA splicing.

<H4>Instructions</H4>


<OL>
 <LI>Create a new Java project in Eclipse. Make sure to add JUnit as
 a library for this project. Any version of JUnit should be
 fine.</LI>

 <LI>Import the file <A HREF="IDnaStrand.java">IDnaStrand.java</A>
 into the project.</LI>

 <LI>Create a new class, called <TT>SimpleStrand</TT>, which
 implements the interface <TT>IDnaStrand</TT>.  If you use the
 features of Eclipse correctly to do this, Eclipse will
 automatically create stubs of all the methods that need to be
 implemented.</LI> 

 <LI>Remember, the whole point of this lab is to write the tests
   first.  Do <I>not</I> edit the stubs of the methods in
 <TT>SimpleStrand</TT>!</LI>

 <LI>Create a new JUnit Test Case (search around for this option
 under File|New).  Make sure to specify <TT>SimpleStrand</TT> as the
 class being tested.  Your test class can be given any reasonable
 name, such as <TT>SimpleStrandTest</TT>.</LI>

 <LI>Now for the interesting part.  Write one or more tests! Easy
 challenge:
 which method(s) need to be tested first? These are the tests you
 will need to write first.</LI>

 <LI>Implement the method(s) for which you have written test(s).</LI>

 <LI>Continue with this pattern: write one or more tests, then
 implement the corresponding methods. Do not edit any method in
 <TT>SimpleStrand</TT> until you have written a comprehensive test
 for it.</LI>

<P>Acknowledgment: <TT>IDnaStrand.java</TT> is taken from the Stanford <A
HREF="http://nifty.stanford.edu/">Nifty
  Assignments repository</A>, and this lab appears to have been
  originally authored by Richard E. Pattis of UC Irvine. However,
  the file is used for a completely different purpose here.  If
  you're interested, you can see the full context for this file in
