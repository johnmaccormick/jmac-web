Notation: Section numbers (e.g. 4.3, 5.2.1) refer to the textbook
(Quinn's <I>Ethics for the Information Age</I>).  References such as
A1, A2 refer to Assignment A1, Assignment A2, and so on.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 1: August 31</FONT></h4>

<P>Brief introduction to the course.  

<P>Practice submitting discussion
questions and responses to the Reading log on Moodle.  

<P>Survey of potential senior projects.  Two possibilities I am aware
of are (i) creating databases and/or web interfaces for the Nature
Conservancy; (ii) implementing algorithms for scheduling tutoring
sessions in the Dickinson writing center.  Please let me know if
you're interested in these possibilities and I will send you more
details.

<P>Description of test-driven development (the <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia
page on test-driven development</A> contains some basic
  information).  The <A HREF="http://junit.org/">official JUnit
  page</A> is a good place to start for using JUnit -- in
  particular, the <A
  HREF="http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm">JUnit
  Cookbook</A> contains a simple, brief tutorial.  Note that Eclipse
  lets you automate many aspects of JUnit, so make sure to read
  about this, experiment with it, and don't hesitate to ask for help
  from the instructor or your classmates.

<P><A HREF="dna-lab">DNA splicing lab</A> to practice
test-driven development.  This lab is ungraded.

<P>Individual discussions of potential project topics if desired.

<P>Note that there is no single ideal structure for a design document.
the content and structure depend on the type of system being
described. Here are some examples of, and templates for, design documents:
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/publications/niobe-ACM-TOS.pdf">paper</a>
written by me and a number of co-authors, describing a system built at
Microsoft around 2005.  The design of the system is described in
Sections 2 and 3, especially Figures 1-4.

class.

<!--   <LI>Quinn Ch3, Questions 13, 14, 26. -->
<!-- </uL> -->


<!-- <P>Required internet research: Use some web research to answer the -->
<!-- following questions. In each case, try to find a reliable source and -->
<!-- bookmark your source so that you can display it in class if asked to -->
<!-- do so.  (Note: Scholarly sources are not required.  Journalistic -->
<!-- articles from established newspapers and news organizations are more -->
<!-- reliable than blogs.  Blogs affiliated with an established news -->

<!-- sources -- the quality of the information must be assessed carefully -->
<!-- on a case-by-case basis. Be prepared to explain why you believe your -->
<!-- source is reliable.)  Questions: -->
