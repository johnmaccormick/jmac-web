    <h2>Reading log instructions</h2>

<P>The Moodle site for this course includes a forum called "Reading
log."  You are required to post to this forum before and after every
class that includes the required reading.

<h3>Before class</h3>

<P>Before every class that includes a required reading, you must
submit a single post to the relevant topic in this forum. The post
will consist of two discussion questions&mdash;questions you think it
would be interesting for the class to discuss as a whole.  The
questions will generally be only one or two sentences long, but feel
free to write longer questions if you want to.

<P>The mechanics of submitting your post are easiest to explain using
an example, so let us consider the second class in this course, which
requires you to read an excerpt from chapter 3 of the book <i>Software
Engineering</i> by Ian Somerville.  Before that class, you need to
click on the "Somerville discussion questions" link on the left of the
reading log forum.  Now click "Reply" in order to submit your post.
Enter your two questions into the Message box on the next page.  When
you are ready, click the "Post to forum" button at the bottom of this
page.  If you're unhappy with your questions, Moodle allows you about
30 minutes to change them before they become frozen.

<h3>After class</h3>

<P>After every class that includes a required reading, you must submit
answers to your own previously-posted discussion questions.  These
answers can be relatively brief (say, two or three sentences each).
If at all possible, they should explicitly reference the class
discussion by incorporating the ideas of your classmates. If we didn't
have time to discuss one of your questions, give your own answer to
the best of your ability.

<P>The mechanics of submitting your answers will again be explained by
using the second class of the course as an example.  First, click on
the relevant topic link on the left of the reading log forum page; in
this case the topic is "Somerville discussion questions."  Locate the
post in which you submitted your questions. Click on the "Reply" link
to this post.  Type your answers into the resulting Message box.  When
you are satisfied with your answers, click the "Post to forum" button
at the bottom of this page.  As with the original post, Moodle will
give you about 30 minutes to make alterations.

<P>Answers to discussion questions must be posted within 24 hours of
the end of class.


<h3>Grading of the reading log</h3>

Failure to post a question or answer by the required time will result
in a zero.  Genuine and reasonable attempts at questions and answers
will score close to 100%.  However, submissions that are obviously
shallow will receive lower scores.
