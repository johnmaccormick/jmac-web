<H2>COMP 131 - Macintosh Tips</H2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Menubars:</b> On Macintosh computers, the application
 menu bars appear at the extreme top of your monitor. They do not
 appear at the top of the application window, where you may be used
 to them from Windows or Linux applications.

  <br><br>

  <li><b>Keyboard "hot keys":</b> Many of these key combinations are 
  as you would expect on Windows, except that you use the <em>command</em>
  key instead of <em>control</em>. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>cut: command-x</li>
    <li>copy: command-c</li>
    <li>paste: command-v</li>
    <li>save: command-s</li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <li><b>Mouse right-click:</b> Macintosh mice look like they have only
  one button, but there are really two inside. By default, both
  buttons do the same thing (left-click), but you can configure your
  account to allow you to right-click as well. To do so:
  <ul>
    <li>click on the apple in the upper-left corner of your screen</li>
    <li>select System Preferences, and then Mouse (in the 2nd row of
    icons)</li>
    <li>in the dropdown box pointing to the right mouse position,
    select "Secondary Button"</li>
    <li>close the Mouse window</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Alternatively, you can simulate a right-click by pressing the <em>control</em> key
  while clicking the (one) mouse button.</li>

  <br>
  <li><b>To view your files:</b> Use the <em>Finder</em> application.
  Its icon looks somewhat like a square blue face, and it is located
  in the tool bar at the bottom of your screen. You should see a
  folder labeled "private" in the left panel of the Finder -- this is
  your Y: drive.</li>

  <br>
  <li><b>To force a "frozen" application to quit:</b> Press the
  <em>option</em>, <em>command</em>, and <em>esc</em> keys
  simultaneously.</li>  

  <br>
  <li><b>To log out:</b> Click on the apple icon in the upper-left
  corner of the screen, then select Log Out.</li>

  <br><br>
 <li><b>Calculator:</b> There is a calculator application in the
  Applications folder. To make the square-root button visible, first
  launch the calculator application, and then select
  <em>Scientific</em> from the <em>View</em> menu.</li>

<br><br>
 <li><b>To create a zip file (for example, to zip a BlueJ
 project):</b>Use the Finder application to 
 locate the folder your BlueJ project is stored in. Right-click on
 the folder, and select Compress "<em>folderName</em>." This will
 create a new file called <em>folderName</em>.zip.
