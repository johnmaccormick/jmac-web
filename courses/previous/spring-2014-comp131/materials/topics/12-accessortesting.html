<OL>
<LI>Download and unpack the Turtle project. 
<LI>Develop a test method for the four argument <code>Turtle</code> constructor: <code>Turtle(double initX, double initY, int initAngle, String initColor)</code>. Be sure to test that the initial values of all 5 fields of the <code>Turtle</code> are set correctly.
<LI>Open the <i>naive-ticket-machine</i> project from chapter 2 of Barnes &amp; Kolling.
<LI>Create a test class for the <code>TicketMachine</code> class.
<LI>Create a test method for the constructor of the <code>TicketMachine</code> class. Can you fully test the constructor? Why not?
<LI>Add an accessor method for the <code>total</code> field of the <code>TicketMachine</code>.  Be sure to include a JavaDoc comment for your method. 
<LI>Now replace your test method from Exercise 5 with one that fully tests the constructor.  If you create a new test method and give it the same name as an existing test method BlueJ gives the option of replacing the old method.
<LI>Add a second constructor to the <code>TicketMachine</code> class. This new constructor should not take any arguments and should set the cost of a ticket to $5.00 (500 cents). Be sure to include a JavaDoc comment for your new constructor. 
<LI>Create a test method for your new constructor.

<H3>Homework Assignment 4b</H3>
<ol>
<!--
<li> Using the <i>Car</i> project, create a test method for the constructor in the <code>Car</code> class. Copy and paste the test method that BlueJ generated as your solution for this question.
-->

Using your <code>Account</code> class from the 
homework assignment from <a href="09-methods.html">Class #9</a> complete the following tasks:

<p><LI>Add an accessor that returns the interest rate of an <code>Account</code>. Copy and paste your new method as your solution to this question.
<li> Create test methods for the three constructors in your <code>Account</code> 
class from the previous homework assignment. Note two constructors
  were provided (one with no parameters and one with the
  <code>initAcctNumber</code> parameter).  You added the third
  constructor to the <code>Account</code> class in the first problem
  of the homework assignment from <a href="09-methods.html">Class
  #9</a>.  If you did not complete this earlier problem successfully,
  see the solution posted outside your professor's door, and add the
  third constructor to the class. 

<p>To complete these exercises, you must first configure BlueJ for unit testing
(unless you have already done so in class).  Go to the BlueJ menu, select 
Preferences, then the Miscellaneous tab, and then check "Show unit testing
tools".  Next, create a test class for the 
<code>Account</code> class.  Compile the class (if it is not already compiled),
and then right-click on it and select "Create Test Class" from the pop-up
menu.  To create a test method, right-click on the test class and select
"Create test method" from the pop-up menu.  Your test methods should use
the accessor methods of the <code>Account</code> class to check that the
constructors have set the fields of the new objects correctly.  Make sure
that the values returned by the accessor methods are the ones that you
expect!
<p>
 Copy and paste the test methods that BlueJ generated as your solution for
 this question.  To find these methods, open the test class in the editor.
 The methods will have the names that you specified when you created them.

<li> Create a test method for the constructor in the <code>Student</code>
 class. Recall that the <code>Student</code> class is contained in the 
 <i>lab-classes</i> project from Chapter 1 in Barnes &amp; Kolling. Copy 
 and paste the test method that BlueJ generated as your solution for this
 question.  You will need to create a test class and test method as 
 described in the previous question.
<LI> Create a test method for the <code>getLoginName</code> method in the
 <code>Student</code> class. Your test method should call the 
 <code>getLoginName</code> method and verify that the return value is as 
 expected.  Copy and paste the test method that BlueJ generated as your
 solution for this question.
