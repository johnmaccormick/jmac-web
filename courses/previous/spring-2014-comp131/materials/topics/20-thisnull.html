<H3>Practice Exercises</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> What error would executing the following code cause and why?
<pre>
  BankCustomer bill;
  System.out.println(bill.getName());
</pre>
<li> Use the BlueJ Debugger to trace several calls to the <code>grade</code>
 method in the <code>GradeCalculator</code> class of the <i>IfExamples-v2</i>
 project.  How many calls do you need to force the debugger to trace
 every statement in the method?
<li> Use the BlueJ Debugger to trace a call to the 
 <code>savingsToChecking</code> method in the <code>BankCustomer</code>
 class.  Try this using both the "Step Into" and "Step" buttons in the
 debugger.  Can you see the difference in what these buttons do?
<li>  Do Exercises 3.35-3.42 in Barnes &amp; Kolling.

<H3>Homework Assignment 6d</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Consider the following constructor definition (from the
 <code>BankCustomer</code> class with fields <code>name</code>,
 <code>address</code>, <code>phoneNum</code>, <code>checking</code>,
 and <code>savings</code>):
<pre>
    public BankCustomer(String initName, String initAddress, String initPhoneNum,
                        Account initChecking, Account initSavings)
    {
        name = initName;
        address = initAddress;
        phoneNum = initPhoneNum;
        checking = initChecking;
        savings = initSavings;
    }
</pre>
Suppose that the formal parameters of the constructors are changed
 to the following:
<pre>
    public BankCustomer(String name, String address, String phoneNum,
                        Account initChecking, Account initSavings)
</pre>
 How can you rewrite the constructor definitions so that the constructors
 will still work correctly (with these formal parameter names)?
 (Hint: use <code>this</code>.)

<li> Add a method to the <code>BankCustomer</code> class to transfer money 
 from one customer's checking account to a different customer's checking
 account.  The signature of this method must be:
<pre>
public void transfer(BankCustomer fromCustomer, int amount)
</pre>
 In other words, the method takes a <code>BankCustomer</code> object
 and an amount to transfer as parameters, and transfers money from
 the checking account of the <code>BankCustomer</code> object passed
 as a parameter to the checking account of the <code>BankCustomer</code>
 object used as the calling object for the method.  
 Your method must display an error message if sufficient funds are not 
 available for the transfer, and not change any account balances in this case.
 Copy and paste your method definition as your answer for this exercise.
<p>
 Hint: it may be helpful to add an accessor method for the checking account
 balance to the <code>BankCustomer</code> class, and then use that
 method in implementing the <code>transfer</code> method.  You may have
 already implemented this accessor in a previous practice exercise.
<li> Write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the method
 you defined in the previous exercise.  Copy and paste the test methods
 generated by BlueJ as your answer for this exercise.
<li> Suppose that a <code>BankCustomer</code> object is created as follows:
<pre>
 BankCustomer melinda = new BankCustomer("Melinda Gates", "Redmond", "123",
                                         null, null);
</pre>
  What error would result from executing the following code (using
       the object created above) and why?
<pre>
  melinda.depositChecking(10000);
</pre>
<li> Use the BlueJ Debugger to trace the execution of the constructor
 for the <code>BankCustomer</code> class.  What values do each of the fields
 contain before the assignment statements in the body of the constructor
 are executed?
