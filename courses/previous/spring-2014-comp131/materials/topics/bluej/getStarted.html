We will frequently use code provided by the authors of your text, which
can be found on the CD that came with your book. To work with it, you
need to copy it from the CD into your network account.

<p>
<b>To copy the code from your CD:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Put the disc from the book into the CD drive (located on the
  right side of the monitor), with the label side facing you.</li><br>
  
  <li>Open the Finder (the blue smiley-face icon on your desktop
  taskbar).</li><br>

  <li>In the Finder window select your "private" folder, which
  should be listed in the left pane.</li><br>

  <li>Open the "CS131" folder your created in Lab 01, or create the
  folder now if you did Lab 01 using your partner's account.</li><br>

  <li>Create a new folder called "book" inside your "CS131"
  folder. (You can do this by selecting "New Folder" from the Finder's
  File menu.)</li><br> 
  
  <li>Now double-click the CD icon on your desktop to open
  it.</li><br>
  
  <li>Navigate to the Projects folder in the CD's Finder
  window.</li><br>
  
  <li>Copy chapter01 through chapter04 from the CD to your new book
  folder. (You can do this by selecting the desired folders and
  dragging them to their new location.)</li><br>
  
  <li>Remove the CD. To do this, "right-click" (ie, hold the
  control key down while clicking with the only mouse button you
  have), and select Eject Objects-First.</li><br>
</ul>

<p>
<b>To open the BlueJ programming environment:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the BlueJ icon on the desktop taskbar.</li><br>
  <li>A dialog will open, asking whether you really want to open BlueJ
  even though it was downloaded from the Internet. Click Open.</li><br>
</ul>

<p>
<b>To open the project you will work with today:</b>
<ul>
  <li>From the BlueJ menu, select Project > Open Project.</li>
  <li>Navigate to your CS131/book/chapter01 folder.</li>
  <li>Select figures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You are now ready to begin working through the text. Please spend the
next part of class reading Sections 1.1 through Section 1.6 and
following the directions there. Notice that there are some
instructions embedded in the regular text and others that are offset
and labelled "Exercises." You should do all of these activities.
