        <dd>A model of a simple CPU with 4 registers and an ALU (with
          operations for addition, subtraction, bitwise-AND, and
          bitwise-OR). This version of the Knob &amp; and Switch does
          not have a Control Unit. Instead, you must play the role of
          the control unit by selecting the input registers, ALU
          functions, and output registers by clicking on the appropriate
          knobs. When you click on the Execute button on the page, a
          single CPU cycle is simulated. You can play with this version
          of the Knob &amp; and Switch simulator until you have a better
          feel for the CPU and what happens within a CPU cycle.

        <dd>This version of the Knob &amp; and switch simulator brings
          us closer to the von Nuemann architecture by adding main
          memory, where data can be stored and retrieved for
          calculations by the CPU. By clicking on switches, it is
          possible to direct data from the main memory to registers
          within a CPU cycle. Likewise, switches can be set so that the
          output of the ALU is directed to main memory as opposed to
          registers. You can play with this version of the Knob &amp;
          and Switch simulator until you have a better feel for the way
          that data flows between the main memory and the CPU.

      <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Answer the following questions using the Basic Knob &amp;
          Switch Computer:
          <ol type="a">
            <li> How must the knobs in the Knob &amp; Switch Computer be
              set in order to subtract the contents of register R1 from
              register R3, and store the result in R2? </li>
            <li> How many CPU cycles would be required in order to add
              the contents of registers R0, R1, and R2 and store the
              result in R3? Describe the settings for each of the
              cycles. </li>
            <li> What is the fewest number of CPU cycles that you could
              use to quadruple the value stored in R1? You do not have
              to specify the knob and switch settings for each cycle.
              Rather, just describe the operation that would be
              performed during each cycle. </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Answer the following questions using the Knob &amp; Switch
          Computer with Memory:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Describe the knob and switch settings required to move
              the contents of Main
              Memory cell 7 into Register R0. Or, to describe the
              operation in pseudocode:
              <xmp> R0 = M[7]
              </xmp>
            </li>
            <li>Describe the knob and switch settings required to add
              the contents of Register R0 and Register R1 and store the
              result in Main Memory cell 5. In pseudocode:
              <xmp> M[5] = R0 + R1
              </xmp>
            </li>
            <li>Is it possible to move the contents of one Main Memory
              cell to another without changing the value? If so,
              describe the steps involved. For example, consider moving
              the contents of Main Memory cell 4 to cell 5:
              <xmp> M[5] = M[4]
              </xmp>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li> How would you store 3 times the value contained in Main
              Memory cell 1 into Register R2? Describe the operation
              that would be performed during each CPU cycle (you do not
              have to specify the knob and switch settings). </li>

            <li> How must the knobs in the Knob &amp; Switch Computer be
              set in order to double the contents of register R2, and
              store the result in R1? <em>For this problem and the ones
                below, your solution must work regardless of what value
                is in R2 and the other registers (i.e. you must compute
                the desired value; you may not assume the desired value
                happens to be stored somewhere handy).</em></li>
            <br>
            <li> How many CPU cycles would be required in order to
              negate (flip the sign) of the contents of register R1, and
              store the result in back in R1? Describe the knob settings
              for each of the cycles.</li>

              Main Memory cells 1 and 2, and store the result in Main

              each cycle. In pseudocode:

              NOT need to describe the knob and switch settings needed
              for each instruction -- just describe the operation itself
              (ie, what the instruction accomplishes).
