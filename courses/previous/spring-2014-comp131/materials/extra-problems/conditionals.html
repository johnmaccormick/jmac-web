<h2>Extra Problems: Conditionals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
  Open BlueJ and, unless you have one already, create a new project called 
  ExtraProblems. Then create a
  new class within your project called Conditionals. This class does
  not need to have any fields or a constructor to initialize them.

  <li>
  <p>
  A nonnegative integer <i>K</i> is divisible by a positive integer <i>L</i>,
  if the remainder after dividing <i>K</i> by <i>L</i> is zero.
  </p>

  <p>
  Write a method called <code>divisible()</code> in your Conditionals
  class that accepts two arguments, <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>. It should
  then return a boolean value reporting whether either of the input
  values is a divisor of the other. <em>Note that when you call this
  method by selecting it from the BlueJ interface, a window will
  automatically pop up in which you can type the argument values.</em>

  <li>
  <p>
  Add the following method to your Conditionals class. Then experiment
  with it and explain why the code probably does not do what the
  programmer intended. 

<pre>
  public String mystery(int num) {
     //if even, increment; if odd, decrement
     if (num % 2 == 0) {
        num++;
     }
     if (num % 2 != 0) {
        num--;
     }

     String result = "Result = " + num;
     return result;
  }
</pre>

  <li>
  <p>
  [This problem comes from "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N. King.]
  <br>In one state, single residents are subject to the following
  income tax:

  <p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Income</th><th>Amount of tax</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Not over $750</td><td>1% of income</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$750-$2,250</td><td>$7.50 plus 2% of amount over $750</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$2,250-$3,750</td><td>$37.50 plus 3% of amount over $,2250</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$3,750-$5,250</td><td>$82.50 plus 4% of amount over $3,750</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$,5250-$7,000</td><td>$142.50 plus 5% of amount over $5,250</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Over $,7000</td><td>$230.00 plus 6% of amount over $7,000</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>
  Write a method called <code>incomeTax()</code> that accepts an
  amount of taxable income as a parameter, and returns the amount of
  tax due.
  
  
<li>
<p>
<b>Classifying Triangles:</b>
<br>[This problem is based on an exercise by Darrah Chavey, Beloit
College.]
</p>

<p>
Write a method that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle
  as parameters, and then returns the classification of the triangle as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>
    <i>invalid input:</i>  all sides must have lengths that are
    strictly positive
    <li>
    <i>not a triangle:</i>  the sum of any two sides must be greater than the
    length of the third
    <li>
    <i>scalene triangle:</i>  no two sides have equal length
    <li>
    <i>isosceles triangle:</i>  two sides (but not the third) are equal
    <li>
    <i>equilateral triangle:</i>  all three sides are equal
  </ul>

</ol>
