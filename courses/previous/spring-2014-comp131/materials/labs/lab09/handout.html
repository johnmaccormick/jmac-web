      For this assignment, you will first complete (and fully test) a
      class
      that represents a song or other audio file that might be played by
      an
      audio player. You will then
      implement a class named <code>PlayList</code> that represents a
      collection of songs. These two classes form an integral part of
      the <i>dPod</i> MP3 music player. Once you have completed their
      implementation you will be able to use the dPod to organize and
      play collections of MP3 audio files.

      </font> </p>
    <p>Create a <code>Lab9</code> folder in your <code>CS131</code>
      folder.
      Download and unpack the <a href="dPod.zip"><i>dPod</i> project</a>
      into your <code>Lab9</code> folder, and use BlueJ to open the <i>dPod</i>
      project. <br>

      </font> </p>
    <p>In this lab, you should only be concerned with the <code>Song</code>
      class and the <code>PlayList</code> class. The <code>Song</code>
      class
      has been started for you (the fields, constructor, and accessor
      methods have been written), but you will need to complete and
      test the remaining methods in <code>Song</code> and the entire
      <code>PlayList</code> class. The test cases that you create must
      achieve statement coverage and must follow the "Testing Rules"
      that we have discussed in class.

    <p><font color="#006400" size="+1"><b>Bonus:</b>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>Implement the <code>shuffle</code> method in the <code>PlayList</code>
      class. In order to implement this method you will need to read
      about how to use the <code>Random</code> class on-line or in the
      textbook. </p>
    <p>Whether or not you elect to complete the bonus you must do two
      things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leave the definition of the <code>Shuffle</code> method in
        place. </li>
      <li>Create a test method that calls the <code>shuffle</code>
        method. This test method
        only needs to invoke the <code>shuffle</code> method, it does
        not have to make any
        assertions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><font color="#006400" size="+1"><b>The dPod Interface:</b>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>To use the dPod create a new <code>DPod</code> object. If you
      have correctly implemented the <code>Song</code> and <code>PlayList</code>
      classes then you should see a window similar to the one shown in
      Figure 1. </p>
    <center><img src="dPod.jpg"><br>
      <b>Figure 1</b>: The dPod.
    </center>
    <p>The dPod interface is divided into 3 main sections: the Master
      PlayList, the PlayLists list and the PlayList Contents. Each of
      these sections is described below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Master PlayList</b>: The Master PlayList contains a list of
        all of the songs that you have added to the dPod. You can add
        additional songs to the Master PlayList by choosing the "Add
        Song to Master PlayList" option from the "dPod" menu. There is a
        collection of MP3 files contained in the "music" folder within
        the <i>dPod</i> project. However, you can also add any of your
        own songs to the dPod by copying the MP3 file for your song into
        the "music" directory within the "dPod" project and adding it to
        the Master PlayList. Songs added to the Master PlayList appear
        in alphabetical order. Currently there is no way to remove a
        song from the Master PlayList.
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li><b>PlayLists</b>: The PlayLists sections shows a list of all
        of the PlayLists that have been created. You can create, rename
        and delete PlayLists using the options on the "PlayList" menu.
        PlayLists appear in alphabetical order.
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li><b>PlayList Contents</b>: The PlayList Contents section shows
        the list of songs that are contained in the selected PlayList.
        You can add songs to a PlayList by selecting the song in the
        Master PlayList, selecting the PlayList to which you want to add
        in the PlayLists list and then choosing "Add Song to PlayList"
        from the "PlayLists" menu. Songs appear in the PlayList in the
        order that you add them. You can remove songs from a PlayList by
        selecting the song in the PlayList Contents section and choosing
        "Remove Song from PlayList" from the "PlayList" menu.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any time you make changes to the Master PlayList, to the list of
      PlayLists or to a specific PlayList you will want to save the
      change by choosing the "Save" option from the "dPod" menu. All of
      your saved songs and PlayLists will be automatically loaded into
      the dPod each time it is started.

    <p><font color="#006400" size="+1"><b>Playing Music in the dPod:</b>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>Music can be played in three different ways within the dPod. The
      most common way to play music is to select a PlayList in the
      PlayLists section and click the "Play" button. This will play each
      song in the selected PlayList one after the other. While the
      PlayList is playing you can use the other buttons to pause/resume,
      stop or change the song that is playing. If a specific song is
      selected in the PlayList Contents section when the "Play" button
      is clicked, the selected song will begin playing and the dPod will
      continue to play the rest of the songs in the PlayList one after
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to playing songs using a PlayList, it is also
      possible to play songs directly from the Master PlayList. To play
      a song from the Master PlayList, first make sure no PlayList is
      selected (you can hold down the Apple key and click in the
      PlayLists section to deselect all PlayLists). Then select the song
      you would like to play in the Master PlayList and click on the
      "Play" button. The dPod will play the selected song and then
      continue to play songs from the Master PlayList one after the
      other.

      </font> </p>
    <p>When you have completed the implementation of the <code>Song</code>
      and <code>PlayList</code> classes, submit your <i>dPod</i>

    <p>The dPod player uses the following libraries to aid in playing
      MP3 files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html">JLayer</a>
        - MP3 Library for the Java Platform from JavaZoom.

        - Implementation of the Java Sound API.

    </ul>
    <p>Each of these libraries is covered by <a

      and is included in the <code>mp3libs</code> directory in the <i>dPod</i>
