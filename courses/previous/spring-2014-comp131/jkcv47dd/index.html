<p>

Download and unpack the <a
href="PrinterQueue.zip"><i>PrinterQueue</i>
project</a>, and complete the implementation of the
<code>PrinterQueue</code> class as specified in the
documentation for that class.  The javadoc comment at
the beginning of the class provides a general
description of the class, and each method and
constructor has a detailed comment.  You must declare
the fields and implement the constructor and all of the
methods for the class.  You must also create a test
class and write test cases that achieve statement
coverage for the constructor and all of the methods that
you have defined.  

<p>You should submit your solution to this exam via Web-CAT.
You may submit your solution as many times as you like
within the two hours allotted.
