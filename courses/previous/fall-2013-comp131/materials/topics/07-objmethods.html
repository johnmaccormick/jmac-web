<H3>Homework Assignment 2c</H3>
<p>
Continue using the <a href = "../examples/Car.zip"><i>Car</i></a> project
to answer the following questions.
<ol>
<li> Create a <code>Car</code> object representing your favorite real
 world car (again), and then use that object to call the <code>print</code>
 method.  What happens?  What information is displayed?  (You can copy 
 this information and paste it in to your answer.)
<li> What does the <code>getYear</code> method do?  What type of value
 does it return?
<li> The <code>equals</code> method takes a <code>Car</code> object as 
 a parameter, and determines whether or not the <code>Car</code> object
 used to call the method and the <code>Car</code> object passed to the
 method as a parameter represent the same real world car.
 Describe a sequence of actions that will make the <code>equals</code>
 method return the value <code>true</code> (using two different 
 <code>Car</code> objects).
<li> Describe a sequence of actions that will make the <code>equals</code>
 method return the value <code>false</code>.
<li> Open the <code>Car</code> class source code in the editor, and then
 switch to the "Documentation" view (by clicking the drop-down box that says
 "Source" and selecting "Documentation").  Use the documentation view to 
 answer the following questions. 
 <ol type = "a">
 <li> What information does the documentation view show about each method?
 <li> Can you tell what each method does just from looking at the documentation
      view (i.e. without ever looking at the source code)?  How?
 <li> Notice that the documentation view does not explicitly list the fields of
      the class - it lists only the constructors and methods.
      Is it possible to guess what the the fields might be by looking at
      the documentation view?  How?
 </ol>
