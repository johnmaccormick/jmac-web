<!--
  Use the <i>clock-display</i> project from Chapter 3 of Barnes and
 Kolling to do the following:
<ol>
<li> Create a new <code>ClockDisplay</code> object using the default
 constructor, and then double click the object to open it in the 
 Object Inspector.
<li> What happens when you double click on the <code>hours</code>
 or <code>minutes</code> fields?  Explain this behavior of the Object
 Inspector in terms of composition.
<li> If you haven't already, double click on the <code>minutes</code>
 field and leave the resulting Object Inspector window open.
 Now invoke the <code>timeTick</code> method on the <code>ClockDisplay</code>
 object.  What happens in the Object Inspector window for the 
 <code>minutes</code> field of the object?  Can you explain this behavior
 in terms of composition?
-->

<li> Consider implementing a system that keeps track of all of the information
  needed for the day to day operation of a video store:
<ol type = "a">
<li> List at least 3 classes (or kinds of objects) that would be useful for
 implementing this system.
<li> What fields would these classes need?  (You do not need to define
 these fields in Java - just describe them in English.)
<li> Describe at least two situations in which composition would be useful
 for implementing this system.
<li> How could abstraction be used in thinking about this system?
</ol>

<H3>Homework Assignment 6a</H3>

<ol>
<!--
<li> You are developing a system for a publishing company that will
 keep track of the information that the company uses in its day-to-day
 operations.  One of your
 colleagues proposes using a <code>Book</code> class that has fields
 for the title, ISBN, number of pages, author's name, author's address,
 author's literary agent's name, and the rate per word that the
 author is paid.  Evaluate this proposed design in terms of the concepts
 discussed in class today (divide-and-conquer, modularization, abstraction,
 potential for reuse).
-->

<!--
<li> Consider implementing a presentation software package (such as
 Microsoft PowerPoint):
<ol type = "a">
<li> List at least 3 classes (or kinds of objects) that would be useful for
 implementing this system.
<li> What fields would these classes need?  (You do not need to define
 these fields in Java - just describe them in English.)
<li> Describe at least two situations in which composition would be useful
 for implementing this system.
</ol>
-->

<LI> Download and unpack the <a href = "../examples/BadCarDesign.zip"><i>BadCarDesign</i></a> project. 

<OL type ="a">
<LI> Discuss the problems with the given design of the
  <code>Car</code> class in terms of the concepts discussed in class
  today (modularization, abstraction).
<!---  (divide-and-conquer, modularization, abstraction,
 potential for reuse).--->

<LI>The <code>Car</code> class in this project is not well designed and would be better implemented using composition.  Improve the design of the <code>Car</code> class using Composition in a way similar to what we did in class to improve the design of the <code>Student</code> class.
<OL type = "i">
<LI>Create new classes to represent objects for the wheels, radio and engine.
<LI>Define the appropriate fields in each of your new classes.  
<LI>Update the definition of the <code>Car</code> class using composition with your new classes.
</OL>

<p>Your classes do not need to contain any constructors or methods, but you should check that your class definitions will compile correctly.  Copy and paste each class definition into your homework submission as your answer for this question.

<!--
<li> Create a new BlueJ project called <i>StudentInfo</i>, and implement
 "skeleton" versions of classes <code>Student</code>, <code>Schedule</code>
 and <code>Course</code> within that project as follows:
  <ol type = "a">
  <li> Create the <code>Course</code> class, and declare fields within
 it so that a <code>Course</code> object can hold the department, number,
 name, room and meeting time of a college course.
 <li> Create the <code>Schedule</code> class, and declare fields within it
 so that a <code>Schedule</code> object can hold the current semester (fall,
 spring or summer) and year, and references to four <code>Course</code> 
 objects that a student might be taking in that semester.
 <li> Create the <code>Student</code> class, and declare fields within it
 so that a <code>Student</code> object can hold the name, HUB box, home
 address and course schedule of a college student.
