      <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
      <p>
        Use the <i>StudentDatabase-v1</i>
        project to complete each of the following exercises:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Should any of the methods that you added to the <code>Student</code>
          class in the practice exercises from our last class be
          declared as <code>private</code>? Justify your answer.
        </li>
        <li> Add a method to the <code>RegistrarsOffice</code> class to
          count and display the number of students who are eligible to
          graduate with each level of latin honors. The minimum GPA
          required to graduate summa cum laude is 3.8, to graduate magna
          cum laude is 3.6, and to graduate cum laude is 3.4. Be sure to
          include a javadoc comment for your method.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Homework Assignment 10b</h3>
      <p>
        Complete the following exercises using
        the <i>LibraryDB</i> project that you started in the last
        homework.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Should any of the method(s) that you added to the <code>Library</code>
          class in the homework exercises from our last class be
          declared as <code>private</code>?&nbsp; If so, change the
          signature of those method(s) so that they are <code>private</code>
          and then make sure that your test cases still pass.
        </li>
        <li> Complete the definitions of the <code>checkOutBook</code>
          and <code>returnBook</code> methods of the <code>Library</code>
          class.
          <p> Hint: make use of a method call for each. </p>
        </li>
        <li> Write test cases for the <code>checkOutBook</code> and <code>returnBook</code>
          methods that properly test those methods.
        </li>
        <li> Modify the constructor of the <code>Book</code> class so
          that the subject of the new book is set to Fly Fishing if the
          parameter for the subject is not one of Math, Computer
          Science, History or Fly Fishing (because all books are about
          Fly Fishing if you really want them to be). Update the javadoc
          for the constructor, and add test cases as appropriate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Save this project. You will be adding to it in the next two
      assignments
      and then submitting it via Web-CAT.
