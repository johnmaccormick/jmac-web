<p>
<ol>
<li> The  <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project contains the test methods for
the <code>max3</code> method that we created in class. Add the two additional 
test methods that are needed to achieve statement coverage for the <code>max3</code>
 method.
 
<li> Modify the <code>withdraw</code> method from the <i>Account-v3</i>
 project so that if a negative amount of money is withdrawn, the method 
 prints an error message and does not change the account balance.
 Then update your testing code as follows:
 <ol type="a">
 <li> test that your modified method still passes all existing test cases.
  If not, modify your method or tests, as appropriate.
 <li> add new test cases to achieve statement coverage for the new version
      of the method
</ol>

<li> The <code>isLeap</code> method from 
  the <code>Date</code> class in the <i>IfExamples-start</i> project
  determines whether a year is a leap year (according to the
rules established in 1384 by Pope Gregory the 13th.) 
Can you, after reading the body of the method, express these rules (in English) for determining if a year is a leap year?  Note that <code>year % 4 == 0</code>
 (for example) is true exactly when <code>year</code> is divisible by 4.

<LI>Create test methods that achieve statement coverage for the <code>isLeap</code> method.

<LI>Prior to Pope Gregory the 13th's decree in 1384, any year that was divisible
 by 4 was a leap year.  Modify the <code>isLeap</code> method from 
  the <code>Date</code> class in the <i>IfExamples-start</i> project
 to correctly determine whether years before 1384 were leap years. For
 the years 1384 and later, the method should still work exactly as it did
 before your modification.  Add additional test cases as needed to achieve
 statement coverage for the modified method.

<H3>Homework Assignment 5b</H3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> The following problems all refer to the <code>grade</code>
 method from the <code>GradeCalculator</code> class in the
 <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project:
<ol type="a">
<li> 
 Write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the <code>grade</code>
 method.
 Copy and paste the test method(s) that BlueJ generated into your solution for 
 this part of this exercise.
<li> Change the first line of the <code>grade</code> method to:
<pre>
   int pct = (score / numPoints) * 100;
</pre>
 and run your unit tests for this method.  Explain what happens
 and why.  Before continuing be sure to undo this change.

<li> Now change the order of the <code>if</code> statements in the <code>grade</code>
method as shown below:
<pre>
        if (pct &gt;= 90) {
            letGrade = "A";
        } else if (pct &gt;= 70) {
            letGrade = "C";
        } else if (pct &gt;= 80) {
            letGrade = "B";
        } else {
            letGrade = "other";
        }
</pre>
Run your tests from part a again. Which of your test methods fail when you run your tests? Explain why each of those tests failed.  Be sure to undo this change before continuing.

</ol>
<li> Complete the implementation of the <code>passingGrade</code> method
 in the <code>GradeCalculator</code> class in
 the <i>IfExamples-v1</i> project according to the given specification.
 Copy and paste the <code>passingGrade</code> method into your solution
 for this exercise.
<li> Write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the
 <code>passingGrade</code> method that you implemented in the previous
 exercise.
 Copy and paste the test method(s) that BlueJ generated into your solution for 
 this exercise.
