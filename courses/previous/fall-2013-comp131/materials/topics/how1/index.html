<UL> 

  <LI> Computer hardware is the set of physical components that make 
up a computational device.

  <LI> Some examples of hardware include:


  <UL>
      <LI> The output devices, such as a printer or monitor, that 
provides feedback for the user;
      <LI> The input devices, such as a mouse or keyboard, that are the 
means by which a user interacts with the computer;
      <LI> The motherboard, the electronic circuit board(s) that 
contains many of the major components of the computer, 
not the least of which is the Central Processing Unit.

  </UL>

<BR><BR>
<CENTER> <B>von 
Neumann architecture</B> </CENTER>
<BR><BR>

  <LI> A computer follows the von Neumann architecture (also known
  as the stored program architecture) and has three basic parts:


  <OL>
      <LI> the central processing unit (CPU)
      <LI> computer memory,
      <LI> input and output devices (peripherals)

  </OL>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="arch.gif">
</CENTER>  

<BR><BR>
<CENTER> <B>The Central Processing Unit</B> </CENTER>
<BR><BR>

  <LI> The Central Processing Unit (CPU) functions as the "brain" of the 
computer.

  <UL>

    <LI> It directs execution of instructions received from 
software, and manages the low-level internal workings of the 
computer.

    <LI> It is composed of three parts:

    <OL>
      <LI> The Program Control Unit (PCU) acts as the "conductor" 
of the computer

      <UL>

        <LI> It retrieves program instructions from main 
memory and determines the type of instruction
        <LI> It also 
coordinates the transfer of data within the CPU and 
throughout the computer.
        <LI> Once decoded, most instructions are carried out by 
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

      </UL>


      <LI> The Arithmetic Logic Unit functions as the "orchestra."

      <UL>

        <LI>  It 
performs simple math operations on the inputs it is given, 
and produces a result. 
        <LI> These operations can be addition or 
logic, such as AND and OR comparisons.

      </UL>

      <LI> Additionally, the CPU contains special memory cells called
  registers that store the data the CPU is currently manipulating

      <UL>

        <LI> they function as a scratch space

      </UL>

    </OL>

<p align="left"><b><a name="cycles">Clock Cycles</a></b></p>

<UL> 

      <LI> A clock cycle
      <UL>

          <LI> a measure of the time required to transfer items 
between the components of the CPU.

          <LI> CPU clock speed now measured in Megahertz (Mhz) or Gigahertz (GHz), 
which means millions or billions of cycles per second, respectively.
	  <LI> Intel has a 3.2 GHz Pentium IV
	  processor and AMD (Advanced Micro 
Design) also has processors over 2 GHz.
          <LI> The PowerPC G4 processors on the lab machines run at 800 Mhz.
          <LI> Since data is transferred as electronic signals, the speed 
of transfers on the chip is limited by the speed at which an electron
can move.
          <LI> The distance between the components becomes a factor 
in clock speed --- the shorter the distance, the faster the 
execution.
          <UL> 
            <LI> This is one reason why people strive to make chips as 
small as possible.
            <LI> Another reason is that you can manufacture more chips 
from the same amount of material
	  </UL>

       </UL>
        
       <LI> Distance is also a factor in main memory access time vs. 
cache access time
          <UL> 
            <LI> Recall that cache is very fast memory that is physically close to the CPU and holds a copy of portions of main memory

            <UL>
              <LI> when a memory access would normally occur, cache is first examined to determine if it has a copy of that piece of data
            </UL>

            <LI>  If you think of the the distance from the CPU to 
cache located on the same chip as the distance from 
Carlisle to Baltimore

            <UL>
              <LI> then the distance to memory off chip is 
about the distance from Carlisle to the Sun
            </UL>

<UL> 

  <LI> Word size
  <UL>
      <LI> the number of bits that can be stored by a register in the CPU
      <LI> on some machines, it is also a measure of the amount of data that can 
be moved to the CPU in a single transfer.
      <UL> 
        <LI> generally includes both the data 
coming from main memory and from I/O devices.
      </UL>

  </UL>


  <LI> The Intel Pentium IV has a word size of 32 bits.  

  <UL>
     <LI> We often say it has a "32-bit architecture".
     <LI> The PowerPC G4 processor on the lab machines is also a 32 bit processor. 
  </UL>


  <LI> Other processors in higher-end machines have already moved 
to 64 bits

  <UL>
      <LI>  Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip is an example of such a
      processor and is used on machines that run as servers.
      <LI>  The PowerPC G5 seen on Apple's new G5 machines also has a word size of 64 bits.

  <LI> The CPU contains small, high-speed memory cells used to store temporary 
results produced by the ALU as well as certain control information. 
  <UL>
      <LI> As we have already seen, this memory is called registers.
  </UL>


  <LI> The early IBM PCs had only 16 registers; the first Pentium chips 
  moved to 32.

  <LI> Some registers on a CPU always store a  particular type of value.

  <UL>
      <LI> An example of such a dedicated register is the Program 
Counter (PC) register 

      <UL>
        <LI> contains the memory address of the next 
instruction to be executed.
        <LI> sometimes called the IP (Instruction Pointer)
      </UL>
      <LI> Another is the Instruction Register (IR)

<p align="left"><b><a name="buses">Buses</a></b></p>

<UL> 

  <LI> A bus is a pathway for sending electrical signals between components. 

  <UL>
    <LI> it is used for communication between the CPU and 
other devices, as well as among the devices themselves.
  </UL>

  <LI> Between memory and the CPU are three main buses

  <UL>
      <LI> The data bus

      <UL>

          <LI> transfers a word of data at a time between memory and the CPU

      </UL>


      <LI> The address bus

      <UL>

          <LI> transfers the address that indicates which location in
  memory we wish to access

          <LI> Suppose a computer needs to access 4 billion 
pieces of information with distinct memory addresses

          <UL>
             <LI> it 
would need to use a 32 bit (4 byte) address to distinguish each
location

          </UL> 

          <LI> Why?
Because each each bit is binary and  2<SUP>32</SUP> is about 4 billion (4 GB).

          <LI> For a processor with a 16-bit wide bus, two transfers would be
needed to assemble the address for each piece of memory, slowing
things down considerably.

  </UL>

      <LI> The control bus

      <UL>

          <LI> transfers control signals indicating whether we are
	  reading to or writing from memory

      </UL>

     
  </UL>

  <LI> These three buses are often grouped together and called the
  system bus or external bus (because it handles communication with
  devices external to the CPU)

  <UL>

    <LI> The system bus may also be connected to other peripherals,
    such as various disk drives

  </UL>

  <LI> The internal CPU bus and the system bus often operate at 
different speeds, with the CPU bus being much faster.

<UL> 

  <LI> Instructions execute within a CPU in a fetch-decode-execute cycle.

  <LI> This is common across all computers (at least at a slightly abstract level).  The cycle proceeds as follows:


  <OL>
      <LI> Fetch the next instruction from memory into the Instruction 
Register (IR).
      <LI> Change the Program Counter (PC) to contain the memory 
address of the following instruction.
      <LI> Determine the type of instruction.
      <LI> If the instruction uses data in memory, determine the addresses 
of the data items.
      <LI> If needed, fetch the data from the specified memory addresses 
into the CPU registers.
      <LI> Execute the instruction.
      <LI> Store the results into the proper place, whether a register, disk, 
or main memory.
      <LI> Return to step 1 and repeat as needed.

  </OL>

  <LI> Note that a single fetch-decode-execute cycle can take several clock
cycles
 
  <UL>
    <LI> though modern processors can reach sustained speeds of one
    instruction per clock cycle (sometimes more!)

  <LI> When I discussed main memory, I also called it RAM, which stands 
for Random Access Memory

  <UL>
      <LI> in random access memory, the time needed to access data is 
independent of its location
   </UL>


  <LI> This is in contrast to sequential access memory (SAM)

  <UL>
      <LI> in which the 
time to access a memory location increases with the distance between 
the current and desired memory location

      <UL>
          <LI> Consider a cassette tape 
          <UL>
               <LI> to get to a song you need to move 
through the tape until you reach the song you are looking for
          </UL>
	  <LI> In a CD, you can simply jump to the song's location 
          <UL>
               <LI> random access 
               <LI> of course, once you are there you must listen to the 
song in sequential order, which is why a CD is sometimes called 
a Direct Access Sequential Disk (DASD)
          </UL>

     </UL>
  </UL>

  <LI> A cassette tape is also an example of another way to characterize 
memory :

  <UL>
      <LI> since you can store data over the data that is already there, it is 
called Read/Write (R/W) memory
      <LI> obviously, a computer's main memory is R/W
  </UL>

  <LI> A music CD, meanwhile, cannot be overwritten with new data

  <UL>

     <LI> it is an example of a Read-Only Memory (ROM) device
     <LI> every computer also has a part of memory that is read only; in 
fact, this part is called ROM
     <UL> 
       <LI> technically speaking ROM is 
random access memory, but the acronym RAM is generally used to mean the 
area of memory on a machine that is R/W memory
     </UL>
     <LI> we already talked about how ROM is utilized when we "boot
     up" a personal computer
