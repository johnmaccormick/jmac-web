You will frequently need to download sample code in order to complete
either the practice exercises or homework problems. These instructions
show you how to download and open the sample code for today's lesson.

<p>
<b>Download the Car project:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click on the link labeled Car.</li><br>
 
  <li>Choose "Save link as..." Then in the dialog window that
  appears, navigate to someplace in your account where you would like
  to put the Car project (for example, a folder called homework in
  your CS131 folder).</li><br>
</ul>

<b>Unzip the project:</b>
<ul>
 <li>Click on the Finder icon (the blue smiley face) on the taskbar, and
  then navigate to the folder where you indicated the downloaded
  project should go.</li> <br>

  <li>At this point, depending on the browser you are using and its
  preference settings, you should find either a folder named Car or a
  file named Car.zip in the folder you indicated for the download. If
  you find Car.zip, you next need to "unzip" it by
  double-clicking on it in Finder. You should see that a new folder named
  Car has appeared in the same folder as Car.zip.</li><br>

  <li>The new Car folder
  contains several files that comprise the Car project, but don't try
  to open the project from within Finder. You must open in from within
  BlueJ.</li><br>
</ul>

<b>Open the project in BlueJ:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Open the BlueJ application.</li><br>
  
  <li>Select Project > Open Project from the BlueJ menu. Then navigate
  to the folder that you downloaded the Car project into.</li><br>
  
  <li>You can recognize BlueJ
  project files in the "Open Project" dialog window because their
  icons have a funny brown shape. (I'm not sure what this shape
  is meant to look like, but once you see it you can remember it as
  the BlueJ project icon.) You can open the Car project by
  double-clicking it.</li><br>
</ul>
