<h2>Extra Problems: Loops</h2>  

<ol>
  <li>
  If you do not already have one, create a new BlueJ project called 
  ExtraProblems.  Then create a new class within your project called Loops. 
  This class need not have any fields or a constructor to initialize them.

  <li>
 <p>
 Write a method within your Loops class that uses a loop to
 print the following to the terminal window.

 <pre>
    10
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    BLASTOFF!
</pre>
 
 <li>
  <p>
  Write a method that uses a loop to print the
  following pattern to the terminal window. 

<pre>
   6   5   4   3   2   1   0  -1  -2  -3
</pre>

  <li>
  Write another method that uses a loop to print this pattern.

  <pre>
   6   8  10  12  14  16  18
  </pre>

  <li>
 <p>
 Write a method that uses a loop to
 print the following to the terminal window.

 <pre>
    1 Java
    2 Java
    3 Java
    4 Java
    5 Java
    6 Java
    7 Java
    8 Java
    9 Java
    IS FUN!
</pre>
 

<li>
Write a method that prints the first 10 multiples of the number 3,
with each number on a separate line. In addition, print "even" or "odd"
after each number, as appropriate. 

  <li>
  <p>
  Write a method that uses a loop to print this pattern.

  <pre>
   Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!
   </pre>

  <li>
Write another to print this pattern. <em>Hint: Use two loops, one inside the
other. The inside loop should print a set of exclamation marks.</em>
  <pre>
   Hello!  Hello!!  Hello!!!  Hello!!!!  Hello!!!!!
</pre>

  <li>
 And this one.
<pre>
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ******
   *******
   ********
   *********
</pre>

  <li>
 And this one.
  <pre>
           *
          **
         ***
        ****

   *********
</pre>

  <li>
  <p>
  Write a method that uses a loop to add the numbers 1 through 10, and
  prints the result (which will be 55).

  <li>
  <p>
  As you may know, the sum of the integers from 1 through n is always equal
to (n)(n+1)/2. Write a method that verifies this formula, for 1<=n<=100.
That is, your program should loop over the values of n from 1 to 100, and
for each value it should compute the sum as done in the previous problem and
compare it to the result from the formula. For each discrepancy found, your
program should print out a message such as "formula doesn't work for n=35".
(Of course, if your program is correct, there will be no output.)
