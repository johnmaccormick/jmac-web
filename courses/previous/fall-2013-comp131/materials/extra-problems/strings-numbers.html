<h2><center>Extra Problems: Strings and Numbers</center></h2>

<h3>Numbers</h3> 

<ol>
 <li>
 Create a new project in BlueJ called ExtraProblems. Then create a
  new class within your project called StringsAndNumbers. This class does
  not need to have any fields or a constructor.

  <p>
  <li>
  A group of poor college students have pooled their pennies, hoping
  they have enough money to visit the Dairy Queen. To avoid annoying the
  ice cream vendor, they take their pennies to a bank to change the money
  into larger coins.

  <p>
  Write a method in your StringsAndNumbers class called
  makeChange. The method should have one parameter that accepts the 
  number of pennies that the students have collected. It should then
  compute and print the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and 
  pennies that they receive from the bank teller. Of course, the teller
  is both accurate and efficient. The students will receive as many
  dollars as possible, as many quarters as possible, etc. For example,
  if the students bring in 82 cents, they will receive 3 quarters, 1 nickel,
  and 2 pennies -- not 1 quarter, 5 dimes, and 7 pennies.

  <p>
  You may assume that when calling your method, the user will enter a
  non-negative number of pennies. 
</ol>


<h3>Strings</h3> 

<ol>
  <li>
  Write a method in your StringsAndNumbers class called
  compoundWords. The method should have two parameters that allow the
  user to enter two simple words when invoking your method. The method
  should then print the two words concatenated together.
  
  <p>
  An example run of your program might look like the following, but 
  be sure to run your program more than once, entering different words
  each time. It should be able to concatenate any two words you enter,
  not just rainbow. 
  <pre>
   First word: rain
   Second word: bow
   The compound word is rainbow.
  </pre>

  <li>
  Now modify your method to produce output that looks like the
  following. This is a bit trickier. 
  <pre>
   First word: rain
   Second word: bow
   rain + bow = rainbow.
</pre>


  
</ol>
