COMP 131 is the entry point in Dickinson's Computer Science curriculum
for students with no previous programming experience. There are no
prerequisites for COMP 131.  If you have taken a Computer Science course or
have prior programming experience please consult with your instructor to see
if COMP 132 may be a more appropriate course for you.
<hr>
<A NAME="goals"></A>
<B>Goals of Instruction</B>
<p>At the end of the course students should be able to:
<ul>
  <li>understand elementary concepts of computer architecture,
  computer programming and software development, including the ability
  to implement and test simple object-oriented programs </li><br>
  <li>use scientific reasoning to evaluate hypotheses about computer
  program outputs</li><br>
  <li>[QR goal] comprehend and create basic numerical and/or logical
  arguments.  For COMP 131, this means that students will use
  abstraction and logical thinking as problem-solving techniques.</li> <br>
</ul>
  
<!--- The following goals were used prior to our official "dept
  assessment" goals being developed in spring 2011.
  <ul>
<li>...teaches you the basics of computer organization and hardware;
<li>...introduces you to computer science as a major scientific
discipline, and to the kind of algorithmic reasoning upon which
computer science is based; 
<li>...teaches you the foundations of object-oriented software development,
 the dominant approach in industry today;
<li>...helps you gain practical experience with the fundamentals of
designing, developing, and testing object-oriented software
<li>...positions you to take more advanced courses in computer science.

Hall, 2012.  ISBN: 9780132492669

<hr>
<A NAME="course format"></A>
<B>Course Format</B>
<P> Class will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and
time spent working semi-independently on the computer ---
completing in-class exercises, experimenting with existing programs,
and completing lab assignments.

<p><b>Attendance and participation:</b> You are expected to attend
every class, on time and ready to participate. It is
particularly disruptive if students miss or arrive late 
to lab sessions since all lab activities will be completed in
pairs. Please don't do it!

<P><b>Homework assignments</b> will be made on a (near) daily basis.
Homework will be due at the beginning of class on the due date.  All
homework exercises will be collected; however, some exercises may not
be graded. All homework assignments must be typed  
(unless otherwise specified).

<P><b>Lab assignments</b> will be due either at midnight of the day before
the next lab period (programming exercises) or at the beginning of
the next lab period (written exercises), unless otherwise specified.
All answers to the lab exercises must be typed.  Most program
code will be submitted through the WebCAT on-line grading system.
You should not turn in printouts of code that has been submitted
through WebCAT.

<p><b>Late submissions of homework and labs</b>:  Late submissions will not
be accepted for credit unless arrangements are made with me in advance or
in case of emergencies.
Emergencies include sudden illness or injury (student or family member), or
events such as automobile breakdowns, that prevent the student from
completing an assignment or attending class to turn in an assignment. Events
under the control of the student,
such as oversleeping or appointments of any kind, do not constitute
emergencies.  In cases that seem questionable, I will require
proof that an emergency occurred.

<!--
 Each student is
permitted two "grace days" over the entire semester. A grace day is an
automatic no-penalty extension until the next class period. Any
assignments that are submitted late after both grace days have been
used will incur a 25% penalty if submitted before the work is returned
to other students, or no credit if submitted afterward.
-->

<!---
Each student is
permitted a total of two no-penalty days of lateness over the entire
semester; every subsequent day of lateness incurs a 25% penalty for
the late assignment.
--->

<P>Partial credit will be earned for making an honest effort on
homework exercises and labs. On the other hand, solutions to
conceptual and computational problems involve logical reasoning, and
logical reasoning is communicated using words as well as logical
symbols and program code.  Therefore, full credit will be earned for
solutions only when they are expressed in a clear, legible, and
grammatically correct fashion, and when they are accompanied by
explanations of the reasoning that led to them. In particular,
answers consisting of only sentence fragments do not constitute
complete solutions and so will not be graded as complete solutions.

<P>As a practical matter, you will want to back up all of your work.
This could save you much frustration in case your files are
accidentally corrupted or deleted. In addition, the files you create
in some labs will be used in later ones; having copies of all of
your work will keep you from having to re-do the work on which these
labs build. Warning: Not having backed up your work is
<B><I>not</I></B> an acceptable reason for failing to submit an
assignment. Good times to make back ups are each time you finish work
for a particular day, and just prior to making major changes in your programs.

<hr>
<A NAME="exams"></A>
<B>Exams</B>
<P>There will be two 50-minute in-class (hand-written) exams and
two 120-minute lab exams. See the <a
href="syllabus.html#requirements">Course Requirements</a> above for
the dates of these exams.
Except in truly exceptional circumstances, discussed with your
instructor <I>prior</I> to missing an exam, neither in-class nor
lab exams will be rescheduled. 

<p>
Because of
the hierarchical nature of computer science as a discipline --- with each
new concept building on the carefully constructed logical edifice of
all that has come before it --- the exams for this course will
necessarily be cumulative. You may expect, however, that all exams for
this course except perhaps the final exam will emphasize the course material 
most recently covered.

<p><b>Conditions for in-class written exams</b>: Each
in-class exam is 50 minutes long.  Each student may
bring into the exam a single sheet of standard
letter-sized paper containing notes on one side.  
<!--
letter-sized paper containing <I>hand-written</I> notes on one side.  
You must write the notes yourself, and they must be originals not
photocopies. 
-->
Apart from this
single sheet of paper, no notes or materials of any kind
may be consulted during the exam.  In addition, no
electronic devices of any kind, including calculators or
cell phones, may be used.  It is highly advisable to
include reasoning or working in all exam answers, as
partial credit for incorrect answers can only be given
if your working demonstrates a correct understanding of
the concepts being examined.

<p><b>Conditions for lab exams</b>:
The lab exams will be held during regularly-scheduled lab periods. In
these exams you will be asked to write a Java program on the
computer.
You may bring any written material you like to the exam, and you may
access materials in your own file system and on the course web pages
during the exam. However, you may not access external websites, and
you may not communicate with other people during the exam (except the
instructor) by any means.

<B>The Key To Success</B>
<P>
The single most important thing that you can do to succeed in this course
is to do a little bit of work each night.  Do not wait to start a homework assignment
until the night before it is due!
The <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/resources/bulletin/Academic-Policies-and-Procedures">Dickinson
College Bulletin</a> states "Credit for courses is based on the assumption 
that at least three hours of study accompany each class period (excluding labs)."  That means
that if you wait until the night before the week's homework is due, you could 
quite reasonably have 9 to 12 hours of work to do.  A much better approach,
as stated above, is to do a little bit of work each night.
<p>
The assignments for this course are structured in a way that is designed to
help you do a little bit of work each night.  There is an individual web
page for each class day.  This page contains the reading assignment for that
day, several practice exercises related to the material covered in class and
in the reading and also the assigned homework questions.  A good strategy is
to do the reading and attempt the practice exercises during the evening 
following the class period.  (Okay, you can do them on Saturday instead of on
Friday night!)  Then attempt the homework questions the following evening.  
<p>
Doing a little work each night using the strategy just described has several
benefits. First, doing the reading and practice exercises right away means
that the material from class is fresh in your mind. It also means that if you
still find something confusing after both the class and the reading, or if you
find the practice exercises difficult, you will have time to consult with a
TA or with your professor before attempting the homework questions the next
night.  Talking with a TA or with your professor for 10 or 15 minutes could
save you hours of struggling with a problem that has you stumped.  Thus,
by working a little bit each night you will usually complete the work for
this course in much less time and with much less frustration than by
attempting to do the work all on the night before it is due.  You will
also learn the material more thoroughly as you go, thus reducing the amount
of time that you will need to spend studying for the exams.

<A NAME="availability"></A>
<B>Lab Availability</B>

<P> In the Tome building, Rooms 118, 120, 122, 231 and 232 are Mac
OS X labs that are configured with the necessary software for COMP
131.  These labs are available whenever the Tome building is open,
except when scheduled for classes.  Room 118 is staffed with a
Teaching Assistant (TA) who should be able to help you with COMP 131
material from 8:00PM -- 11:00PM Sunday through Thursday.

<hr>
<A NAME="integrity"></A>
<B>Academic Integrity</B>

<P>Please take the time to read Dickinson's policy on cheating and
plagiarism contained in the <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/student-life/resources/dean-of-students/content/Community-Standards/#Academic%20Misconduct">
Community Standards</a> document. Violations of this policy are
considered serious transgressions, so you should be especially
certain that you understand your rights and responsibilities under
it.  Students suspected of academic dishonesty will be subject to
the <b>Formal Resolution</b> process outlined <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/student-life/resources/dean-of-students/content/Community-Standards/#Procedures%20for%20Adjudicating%20Misconduct">here</a>; those found guilty will be
subject to disciplinary action and likely earn a failing grade in the
course. If you are unsure about whether or not certain kinds of
collaboration are permissible, ask your instructor.

<p>
<b>Homework Collaboration Policy</b>
<P>Any homework you submit for evaluation must be your own. This means that
any work you submit for evaluation must have been developed by you and
must have been written by you. Although you should feel free to discuss 
strategies and approaches to assigned work with your instructor, the
TAs, and/or your classmates, you must always write up your solutions
<I>alone</I>. 

<P>To avoid inadvertently cheating --- or even the <I>appearance</I> of
cheating --- you should not write anything down when you are discussing
individual work with other students. If you have truly understood the
ideas discussed, then you should have no difficulty reconstructing
them, incorporating them into your solution, and writing up that
solution, all on your own. 

<P>When completing homework for this course, under no circumstances should you
show another student any program code that belongs to you or have in your
possession code that belongs to another student.

<P>If you consult classmates or other sources besides your instructor
in completing any work for this course, then you are obligated to
acknowledge your debt to these sources <I>in writing</I> as part of
your problem solutions. Please be as specific as possible when
acknowledging a source. You might say, for example, "I talked with X
when working on Problem 3" or "I incorporated Y's idea about Z in my
solution to Problem 5." Proper acknowledgment will not negatively
affect your grade, although failure to provide it may.
<!--
 No other student should
ever look at your computer screen, or at a printout or an electronic
copy of any program of yours, or at any code written by you by hand. In
particular, all help writing and debugging individual programs must
come from your instructor or a TA. 
-->

<p>
<b>Lab Collaboration Policy</b>
<p>
You will be assigned a lab partner for each lab session. You and your
lab partner should work together on the lab assignment and submit a
single solution with both of your names on it. You should not collaborate
with students (or others) outside your pair when working on lab assignments.

<p>You should feel free to incorporate
into your solutions code that appears in the labs or on
the course web site, provided you indicate that the code is not your 
own and where you got it from. You may incorporate <I>no</I> other code
into your solutions. In particular, neither code 
written by students who have previously taken the course,
code from other texts or other
instructors, code from friends or relatives, nor code downloaded from
the Internet may be incorporated into your solutions.

<B>Accommodations for Disabilities</B>
<!--- statement provided by Disability Services 8/23/11 --->
<p>
Dickinson College makes reasonable academic accommodations for
students with disabilities. Every professor is available to discuss
the implementation of academic accommodations for students with
documented disabilities.  Students requesting accommodations must
first register with Disability Services to verify their
eligibility. After documentation review, Marni Jones, Director of
Learning Skills and Disability Services, will provide eligible
students with accommodation letters for their professors. Students
must obtain a new letter every semester and meet with each relevant
professor prior to any accommodations being implemented.  These
meetings should occur during the first three weeks of the semester
(except for unusual circumstances), and at least one week before any
testing accommodations. The Office of Disability Services is located
in Biddle House. For appointments call 245-1080. For more information,
see the Disability Services website <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/student-life/resources/disability-services">http://www.dickinson.edu/student-life/resources/disability-services</a>   or email disabilityservices@dickinson.edu.
