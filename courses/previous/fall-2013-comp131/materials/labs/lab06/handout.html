<p><b>Introduction:</b>
</font>
<p>


The most popular toy to hit the scene a few years ago was the "virtual pet"
- an electronic toy that simulated pet behavior (displayed on a screen) and
allowed its "owner" to respond to various types of behavior by performing 
actions (generally pushing buttons).
Owners often find that these toys are more "virtual pests" than
"virtual pets".
Jeffrey L. Popyack at Drexel University has adapted this idea into a 
nifty programming assignment, as described below.
<p>

 The behavior of a virtual pest can be described using a 
<i>finite state machine</i>.
For example, consider a simple virtual fish that is perpetually in one of
four <i>states</i>: <b>hungry</b>, <b>sleepy</b>, <b>full</b> or 
<b>grouchy</b>.  The fish indicates the state that it is in by making
a particular sound and performing a particular action.
The fish also interacts with its owner by changing its state in response
to owner actions.  This is shown in the virtual pest interface (see
Figure 1), where owner actions appear as buttons.
<p>

<p><b>Figure 1:</b> Fred the fish as a virtual pest.
</center>

The state of the fish will change depending on the actions of its owner or
just the passing of time.
If a fish is <b>hungry</b>, and its owner feeds it, it becomes <b>full</b>.
Also, if a <b>hungry</b> fish is not fed, after some time interval it will
become <b>sleepy</b>, and so on.  
<!-- A <b>full</b> fish becomes <b>grouchy</b> after some
time interval, and if the owner pets a <b>full</b> fish, it becomes
<b>sleepy</b>.  If the owner pets a <b>grouchy</b> fish, it becomes 
<b>hungry</b>.  If a fish is <b>sleepy</b> and its owner puts it to bed,
it becomes <b>grouchy</b>.  Finally, a <b>sleepy</b> fish will become
<b>hungry</b> after some time interval.
<p>
-->
 The diagram below (Figure 2) describes this behavior as a finite state
 machine.  The machine has four states, which are drawn as circles labeled
with the state's name.  The machine is always in exactly one of these
states.  The machine may make a <i>transition</i> from one state to another
as specified by the arrows connecting the states.  Transitions are triggered
by the actions of the pest owner or just the passing of time.
For example, the
arrow labeled <b>feed</b> connecting the <b>hungry</b> state to the
<b>full</b> state means that feeding a <b>hungry</b> fish causes it to
become <b>full</b>.  The label <b>random</b> means "after some 
(random) time interval".  The arrow entering the <b>hungry</b> state
from nowhere means that <b>hungry</b> is the <i>initial state</i> -
the state that a fish starts in.
<p>

The virtual pests available commercially generally have very many states and
there are many ways in which their owners can interact with them.
They also sometimes have <i>terminal states</i>, that is, states from which
the pest cannot exit because no arrows leave the state.
Typically, the pest is said to have died if it enters such a state.

<p><b>Part A: Implementing the Pet Fish</b>
</font>
<p>

For the first part of this assignment, you will implement a pet fish
with the behavior described above.  That is, you will implement the
finite state machine given in Figure 2.  To simplify the implementation,
we will assign an integer to each state and each owner action.  These numbers
will be used internally in your program to represent the state and
action.  We will also write methods that map these numbers to meaningful
state and action names to display to the user.
<p>
For example, the states and actions for Fred the fish can be mapped
to integers as follows:

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th align="center">state</th> <th>number</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>hungry</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>sleepy</td> <td align="center">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>full</td> <td align="center">3</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>grouchy</td> <td align="center">4</td> </tr>
</table>
</td>
<td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th align="center">action</th> <th>number</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>random</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>feed</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>pet</td> <td align="center">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>put to bed</td> <td align="center">3</td> </tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
The finite state machine can be written with these numbers for the
states and transitions as follows in Figure 3.
<p>

<center>

<p><b>Figure 3:</b> The finite state machine from Figure 2 using numbers
 for state and action names.
</center>
<p>
In each state, Fred makes a characteristic sound and performs a habitual
action.  These sounds and actions are given in the following table.

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th align="center">state</th> <th>pest sound</th> <th>pest action</th></tr>
<tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">blurp!</td> 
  <td align="center">swim to top</td></tr>
<tr> <td align="center">2</td> <td align="center">zzZZzzzZz</td> 
  <td align="center">lay on bottom</td></tr>
<tr> <td align="center">3</td> <td align="center">BLURP!</td> 
  <td align="center">sulk on bottom</td></tr>
<tr> <td align="center">4</td> <td align="center">blurp! bubble bubble ...</td> 
  <td align="center">swim to bottom</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>

To begin implementing the behavior of Fred the fish, create a 
<code>Lab06</code> folder in your <code>CS131</code> folder.
Download and unpack the <a href="DemoPest.zip"><i>DemoPest</i> project</a>
into your <code>Lab06</code> folder, and use BlueJ to open it.
Create an instance of the <code>VirtualPest</code> class, using "Fred"
as the name of the pest, and with an initial state of 1.
Then create an instance of class <code>VirtualPestGUI</code> using 
the constructor that takes a <code>VirtualPest</code> as a parameter (pass
it the <code>VirtualPest</code> that you just created).
Fred the fish will appear, but the 
buttons for interacting with him will not work - 
Fred's state will always be <b>hungry</b>, no matter which buttons
are pushed.  Also, Fred will not make any sounds or perform any actions.

<p>
In BlueJ, double click the <code>VirtualPest</code> class to open it
in the editor.  The fields, constructor and several methods of the
class are provided for you.  Your task is to implement the remaining
methods according to the given specifications.
These methods are: <code>getPestSound</code>, <code>getPestAction</code>
and <code>doAction</code>.  The pest sounds and actions for each state
are given in the above tables.  
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: you are NOT allowed to use multiple return statements within
 one method definition.  Instead, you should use a local variable to hold
 the return value from the method, and use one return statement at the end
 of method to return the value of that variable.
<p>
 The <code>doAction</code> method must
 implement the finite state machine given in Figure 3. 
 This method takes an action as a parameter, and changes the
 state of the virtual pest depending on the combination of this
 action and the current state of the pest, exactly as specified by the
 finite state machine.  For example, if the current state of the pest
 is <b>hungry</b> (state 1) and the owner feeds the pest (action 1),
 then the state of the pest becomes <b>full</b> (state 3).
 In addition to the owner actions, the graphical interface will also 
 periodically pass
 the random action (action 0) to this method.  In each state, the pest will
 typically only
 respond to some of the possible owner actions (or random) - other actions
 will not change the pest's state.
<p>
 You must also provide test cases that achieve statement coverage for
 the three methods that you define.  Test cases for the other methods
 are included with the project.  Note that the constructor for the
 <code>VirtualPest</code> class takes a state number as a parameter -
 this is very useful for writing test cases that depend on the pest 
 being in a particular state.
<p>
 Once you have completed the implementation of the <code>VirtualPest</code> 
 class, be sure to create an instance and then pass that instance as a 
 parameter when you create an instance of the <code>VirtualPestGUI</code>
 class.  Now you can see Fred the fish in action!

<p><b>Part B: Designing Your Own Pest</b>
</font>
<p>

For the second part of this assignment, you must design and implement
your own virtual pest.  Note that this pest will be implemented in a
separate project - do NOT modify your <i>DemoPest</i> project for this
part of the assignment.
<p>
Your pest must have at least 5 states, and
must respond to at least 4 actions (including the <b>random</b> action).
In the design process, you need to do all of the following:
<ol>
<li> Choose the states that your pest can be in, and assign a number
 to each state. 
<li> Decide what sound your pest makes and how it acts while in each state.
 For example, when it is sleepy, it may snore.  When it is hungry, it may beg.
<li> Choose the owner actions that your pest responds to, and assign a number
 to each action.  These should be
 interactions of the owner with the pest, such as petting, feeding, ...
 Note that the number for the <b>random</b> action must be 0, and the
 remaining actions must be numbered consecutively starting with 1.
<li> Decide how the pest reacts to owner actions (and the <b>random</b>
  action) while in each state, and record these decisions in a finite
  state machine.  That is, your finite state machine should depict which 
  states may be reached from which other states, and under what conditions, 
  as in the example in Figure 2.  You must include at least one
  <b>random</b> transition.
  Label each state with both the state name and state number, and each
  transition with both the action name and action number.
 <p>
  Note that your pest does NOT need to respond to every owner action in
  every state - that is, you should not have a transition
  from every state to every other state.
</ol>
  The information from points 1 - 3 above must be recorded in tables
 (similar to the tables given above), and you must draw a finite state
 machine for point 4.  These tables and the finite state machine must
 be submitted at the beginning of the next lab period.
<p>
 
  Finally, implement your virtual pest.  Download and unpack the 
 <a href="MyPest.zip"><i>MyPest</i> project</a>, and use the 
 <code>VirtualPest</code> class in this project to implement your 
 pest.  You must implement the
 <code>getPestSound</code>, <code>getPestAction</code> and 
 <code>doAction</code> methods as in part A, and also several additional
 methods.
<p>

  The <code>getNumActions</code>, <code>getAction</code> and 
 <code>getFile</code> methods are used for building the graphical interface
 for the virtual pest.  See the <i>DemoPest</i> project for examples of
 implementing these methods.  The <code>getFile</code>
 method should simply return a file name (as a String).  This file must
 be a GIF or JPEG image file (containing a picture of the virtual pest), 
 and the file must be located in the <i>MyPest</i> project directory.
 The <code>getNumActions</code> method should simply return the number of 
 owner actions that the pest can respond to (NOT including the <b>random</b>
 action, since all pests can respond to <b>random</b>).  For example, if the
 pest responds to feeding, petting and being put to bed, 
 <code>getNumActions</code> should return 3.
 The <code>getAction</code> method takes a number as a parameter, and returns
 the owner action (as a String) corresponding to that number.  
 The numbers should range from 1 up to the number returned by 
 <code>getNumActions</code>.
 For example, <code>getAction</code> might return "feed" when passed 1, "pet"
 when passed 2, and "put to bed" when passed 3.  For any other number,
 it should return the empty string "".
 The <code>getState</code> method returns the state that the pest is
 currently in as a String, or "error" if the pest is in a nonexistent state.
<!--
<p>
 Note that the <code>VirtualPestGUI</code> class has a second constructor 
 that takes a <code>VirtualPest</code> and a <code>boolean</code> as 
 parameters.  This constructor can be used for testing your own virtual pest,
  and also to control whether or not the state
 of the virtual pest appears directly in the interface.
-->
<p>
 As with the <i>DemoPest</i> project, you are not allowed to use multiple
 return statements within one method definition for this project.
<p>
 You must also provide test cases that achieve statement coverage for
 all of the methods and constructors in the <code>VirtualPest</code>
 class (including the method and constructor that are provided for you).
<p>
 Submit your project via WebCAT.  Note that WebCAT can not do 
 correctness testing for your <i>MyPest</i> project, as it does not know
 how your pest is supposed to behave!  However, WebCAT will
 evaluate whether or not your test cases achieve statement coverage.
 Additionally, WebCAT will not accept your submission until you have at
 least created a test class for the <code>VirtualPest</code> class.
<p>
  In addition to your implementation,  you must also hand in the finite
 state machine and tables for your pest as specified above.
 Your tables and finite state machine are due at the beginning
 of the next lab period.
<!--
<p>
 Points for parts A and B of this lab will be distributed as follows:
 <ul>
 <li> 30 points for part A, all assigned via WebCAT correctness, style
 and test coverage checking.
 <li> 40 points for part B assigned via WebCAT style and test coverage
 checking.
 <li> 30 points (for both parts A and B) assigned by your instructor.
 The bulk of these points will be for the correctness of part B.
</ul>
-->

<p>
<font size=+1 color='#000064'>
<p><b>Part C: Bonus Problem</b>
</font>
<p>

 Modify your <code>getFile</code> method (in the <i>MyPest</i> project)
 so that it 
 returns a different file name for each state of the virtual pest, and
 find or create image files (in GIF or JPEG format) corresponding to each
 state and place them in the <i>MyPest</i> folder.
 This will cause the image displayed in the interface to change each time
 the state of the pest changes.  Note that this will work best if all of
 your images have approximately the same dimensions.
 You will also need to write new test cases for your <code>getFile</code>
 method (to achieve statement coverage).  You do not need to submit this
 part of the assignment separately - just include these modifications
 in your submission to WebCAT.
