 Tribbles</a> are simple creatures who live on a rectangular world.
 Each day, a tribble moves about on the world and ages.  A tribble
 will occasionally reproduce (by budding - only one tribble is required)
 and eventually die.  Each tribble has a number (the first
 tribble "born" is 1, the second is 2 and so on), a color, an age
 and a position on the world.  Figure 1 shows a picture of the tribble
 world as the tribbles go about their daily lives:

The behavior of tribbles is implemented in a Java class.  Unfortunately,
that class has not yet been finished!

<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<p><b>Setup:</b>
</font>
								       
<p>Create a <code>Lab5</code> folder in your <code>CS131</code> folder.
Download and unpack the <a href="Tribbles.zip"><i>Tribbles</i> project</a>
into your <code>Lab5</code> folder. Use BlueJ to open the <i>Tribbles</i>
project. 

<p>
To see the tribble world, create an instance of the <code>TribbleGUI</code>
class, and then use this instance to invoke the <code>display</code> method.
You can then click the "Start" button in the user interface to make the
tribbles appear.  However, because the behavior of these tribbles has not yet
been implemented, all of the tribbles will appear in the upper left corner
of the world and all will be green.  Additionally, when you click
the "Next Day" button, the tribbles will not be able to move.

<p><b>The Assignment:</b>
</font>
								       
<p>The <i>Tribbles</i> project contains 2 classes.  In this lab, you should
only be concerned with the <code>Tribble</code> class - you will be
writing the fields, constructors and methods for this class, as well
as test cases that achieve statement coverage for the constructors and
methods.
<p>
After opening the project in BlueJ, double click the <code>Tribble</code> 
class to bring it up in the editor.  Use the interface view to determine
what the methods and constructors for the class need to do, and to infer
what the fields of the class should be.  Then switch to the implementation
view to complete the source code for the class.  Add the necessary field
definitions, and fill in the code for each constructor and method.
Do NOT change any of the method or constructor signatures, as the 
methods and constructors are used by the <code>TribbleGUI</code> class.
Note that several of the methods have return statements that simply
return some constant value.  The only purpose of these statements is
to allow the class to compile.  You will need to replace these return 
statements when you begin working on those methods.
<p>
Note that the upper left corner of the tribble world is position (0, 0),
and that the lower right is position (75, 15).  When a tribble moves, you
MUST ensure that the tribble does not fall off of the world.  Instead,
the tribble should ``wrap around'' - for example, if the tribble attempts
to move off of the bottom of the world, it should reappear at the top.
<p>
You must also write test cases to ensure that your tribbles behave 
correctly.  The best approach is to implement one constructor and the
accessor methods first, and then write one or more test cases for that
constructor.  Then implement the next constructor and test case(s) for it.
Finally, move on to the mutator methods, writing test case(s) as you
complete each mutator.  Rerun your tests as you complete each method or
constructor.
<p>
Grading will be based on three criteria:
<ul>
<li> style
<li> correctness
<li> whether or not your test
cases achieve statement coverage for all constructors and methods in
the <code>Tribble</code> class.
</ul>

<p><b>Submitting Your Solution:</b>
</font>
								       
<p>When you have completed the implementation the <code>Tribble</code> class,
submit your solution using the WebCAT system.  Note that WebCAT will not
accept your submission if you have not created a test class for the
<code>Tribble</code> class.
You are allowed to submit your solution as many times as you like, and
you are encouraged to begin submitting your solution as soon as you have
created the test class.
