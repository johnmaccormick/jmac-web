<p><b>Introduction:</b>
</font>

<p>

For this assignment, you will first create a class that represents a
song or other audio file that might be played by an audio player.
After completing (and fully testing) your <code>Song</code> class, you will then
implement a class named <code>PlayList</code> that represents a collection of songs.  These two classes form an integral part of the <i>dPod</i> MP3 music player.  Once you have completed their implementation you will be able to use the dPod to organize and play collections of MP3 audio files.

<p><b>Setup:</b>
</font>
								       
<p>Create a <code>Lab9</code> folder in your <code>CS131</code> folder.
Download and unpack the <a href="dPod.zip"><i>dPod</i> project</a>
into your <code>Lab9</code> folder, and use BlueJ to open the 
<i>dPod</i> project.  

<br>

<p><b>The Assignment:</b>
</font>
								       
<p>In this lab, you should only be concerned with the <code>Song</code>
class and the <code>PlayList</code> class - you will be completing the
fields, constructors, and methods for these classes.  In addition you will
need to create test cases for all of the code that you write.  The test cases
that you create must achieve statement coverage and must follow the "Testing Rules" 
that we have discussed in class.

<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<p><b>Bonus:</b>
</font>
<p>Implement the <code>shuffle</code> method in the <code>PlayList</code> class. 
In order to implement this method you will need to read about how to use the 
<code>Random</code> class on-line or in the textbook.  

<p>Whether or not you elect to complete the bonus you must do two things:
<UL>
<LI>Leave the definition of the <code>Shuffle</code> method in place.  
<LI>Create a test method that calls the <code>shuffle</code> method.  This test method
only needs to invoke the <code>shuffle</code> method, it does not have to make any
assertions.
</UL>

<p><b>The dPod Interface:</b>
</font>

<p>To use the dPod create a new <code>DPod</code> object.  If you 
have correctly implemented the <code>Song</code> and <code>PlayList</code>
classes then you should see a window similar to the one shown in Figure 1.

<b>Figure 1</b>: The dPod.
</center>

<p>The dPod interface is divided into 3 main sections: the Master PlayList, the PlayLists list and the PlayList Contents.  Each of these sections is described below:

<UL>
<LI><b>Master PlayList</b>: The Master PlayList contains a list of all of the songs that you have added to the dPod.  You can add additional songs to the Master PlayList by choosing the "Add Song to Master PlayList" option from the "dPod" menu. There is a collection of MP3 files contained in the "music" folder within the <i>dPod</i> project.  However, you can also add any of your own songs to the dPod by copying the MP3 file for your song into the "music" directory within the "dPod" project and adding it to the Master PlayList. Songs added to the Master PlayList appear in alphabetical order. Currently there is no way to remove a song from the Master PlayList. 

<p><LI><b>PlayLists</b>: The PlayLists sections shows a list of all of the PlayLists that have been created.  You can create, rename and delete PlayLists using the options on the "PlayList" menu. PlayLists appear in alphabetical order.

<p><LI><b>PlayList Contents</b>: The PlayList Contents section shows the list of songs that are contained in the selected PlayList.  You can add songs to a PlayList by selecting the song in the Master PlayList, selecting the PlayList to which you want to add in the PlayLists list and then choosing "Add Song to PlayList" from the "PlayLists" menu.  Songs appear in the PlayList in the order that you add them. You can remove songs from a PlayList by selecting the song in the PlayList Contents section and choosing "Remove Song from PlayList" from the "PlayList" menu.
</UL>

<p>Any time you make changes to the Master PlayList, to the list of PlayLists or to a specific PlayList you will want to save the change by choosing the "Save" option from the "dPod" menu.  All of your saved songs and PlayLists will be automatically loaded into the dPod each time it is started.

<p><b>Playing Music in the dPod:</b>
</font>

<p>Music can be played in three different ways within the dPod. The most common way to play music is to select a PlayList in the PlayLists section and click the "Play" button.  This will play each song in the selected PlayList one after the other.  While the PlayList is playing you can use the other buttons to pause/resume, stop or change the song that is playing.  If a specific song is selected in the PlayList Contents section when the "Play" button is clicked,  the selected song will begin playing and the dPod will continue to play the rest of the songs in the PlayList one after the other.

<p>In addition to playing songs using a PlayList, it is also possible to play songs directly from the Master PlayList.  To play a song from the Master PlayList, first make sure no PlayList is selected (you can hold down the Apple key and click in the PlayLists section to deselect all  PlayLists).  Then select the song you would like to play in the Master PlayList and click on the "Play" button.  The dPod will play the selected song and then continue to play songs from the Master PlayList one after the other.

<p><b>Submitting Your Solution:</b>
</font>
								       
<p>When you have completed the implementation of the <code>Song</code>
and <code>PlayList</code> classes, submit your <i>dPod</i>
project to WebCAT.

<p><b>Credits:</b>
</font>

<p>The dPod player uses the following libraries to aid in playing MP3 files:
<UL>
<LI><a href="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html">JLayer</a> - MP3 Library for the Java Platform from JavaZoom.
<LI><a href="http://www.javazoom.net/mp3spi/mp3spi.html">MP3SPI</a> - MP3 Service Provider Interface from JavaZoom.
<LI><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tritonus/">Tritonus</a> - Implementation of the Java Sound API.
</UL>

<p>Each of these libraries is covered by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">the LPGL license</a> and is included in the <code>mp3libs</code> directory in the <i>dPod</i> project.
