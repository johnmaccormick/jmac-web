      COMP 131 is the entry point in Dickinson's Computer Science
      curriculum for students with no previous programming experience.
      There are no prerequisites for COMP 131. If you have taken a
      Computer Science course or have prior programming experience
      please consult with your instructor to see if COMP 132 may be a
      more appropriate course for you.

      <hr> <a name="goals"></a> <b>Goals of Instruction</b>
      <p>Goals specific to this course are that students can: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>understand elementary concepts of computer architecture,
          computer programming and software development, including the
          ability to implement and test simple object-oriented programs
        </li>
        <li>use scientific reasoning to evaluate hypotheses about
          computer program outputs</li></ol>
        <P>COMP131 counts as a <em>Quantitative Reasoning</em> (QR)
        course at Dickinson. Therefore, the following college-wide QR
        goal is also a goal of COMP131. Students can
	  <ul>
	    <li>comprehend and create basic numerical and/or logical
	arguments.  (For COMP131, this means that students will use
	abstraction and logical thinking as problem-solving
	techniques.)</ul>

        <p>COMP131 counts as a <em>Division III lab science</em>
        (DivIII) course at Dickinson.  Therefore, the following three
        college-wide DivIII goals are also goals of COMP131.  Students
        will acquire:
	  <ol>
  <li>the ability to use scientific methods as a way of understanding the world
  <li>knowledge of content and principles within the natural sciences
  <li>ability to critically evaluate claims from a scientific perspective
    </ol>
      <!--- The following goals were used prior to our official "dept
  assessment" goals being developed in spring 2011.
  <ul>
<li>...teaches you the basics of computer organization and hardware;
<li>...introduces you to computer science as a major scientific
discipline, and to the kind of algorithmic reasoning upon which
computer science is based; 
<li>...teaches you the foundations of object-oriented software development,
 the dominant approach in industry today;
<li>...helps you gain practical experience with the fundamentals of
designing, developing, and testing object-oriented software
<li>...positions you to take more advanced courses in computer science.
</ul>

      <p> <i>Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using
          BlueJ</i>, fifth edition. David J. Barnes and Michael Kolling.
        Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2012. ISBN: 9780132492669 </p>
      <hr> <a name="course format"></a> <b>Course Format</b>
      <p> Class will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and time spent
        working semi-independently on the computer --- completing
        in-class exercises, experimenting with existing programs, and
        completing lab assignments. </p>
      <p><b>Homework assignments</b> will be made on a (near) daily
        basis. Homework will be due at the <b>beginning of class on
        the due date</b>. All homework exercises will be collected on
        the due dates; however, some exercises may not be graded. All
        homework assignments must be typed, but any diagrams or minor
        changes can be drawn by hand.  All exercises should be clearly
        identified by name and number.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lab assignments</b> will be due either at <b>11:59pm of
          the day (Wednesday) before the next lab period</b>
          (programming exercises) or at the <b>beginning of the next
          lab period </b>(written exercises), unless otherwise
          specified. All answers to the lab exercises must be
          typed. Again, diagrams and minor changes can be drawn by
          hand. Most program code will be submitted through the WebCAT
          on-line grading system. You should not turn in printouts of
          code that has been submitted through WebCAT. </p>
      <p><b>Late submissions of homework and labs</b>: Late submissions
        will not be accepted for credit unless arrangements are made
        with the instructor in advance or in case of emergencies.
        Emergencies include sudden illness or injury (student or family
        member), or events such as automobile breakdowns, that prevent
        the student from completing an assignment or attending class to
        turn in an assignment. Events under the control of the student,
        such as oversleeping or appointments of any kind, do not
        constitute emergencies. In cases that seem questionable, I will
        require proof that an emergency occurred.
        <!--
 Each student is
permitted two "grace days" over the entire semester. A grace day is an
automatic no-penalty extension until the next class period. Any
assignments that are submitted late after both grace days have been
used will incur a 25% penalty if submitted before the work is returned
to other students, or no credit if submitted afterward.
--><!---
Each student is
permitted a total of two no-penalty days of lateness over the entire
semester; every subsequent day of lateness incurs a 25% penalty for
the late assignment.
---> </p>
      <p>Partial credit will be earned for making an honest effort on
        homework exercises and labs. On the other hand, solutions to
        conceptual and computational problems involve logical reasoning,
        and logical reasoning is communicated using words as well as
        logical symbols and program code. Therefore, full credit will be
        earned for solutions only when they are expressed in a clear,
        legible, and grammatically correct fashion, and when they are
        accompanied by explanations of the reasoning that led to them.
        In particular, answers consisting of only sentence fragments do
        not generally constitute complete solutions and so will not be
        graded as complete solutions. </p>
      <p>As a practical matter, you will want to <b>back up all of your
          work</b>. This could save you much frustration in case your
        files are accidentally corrupted or deleted. In addition, the
        files you create in some labs will be used in later ones; having
        copies of all of your work will keep you from having to re-do
        the work on which these labs build. Warning: Not having backed
        up your work is <b><i>not</i></b> an acceptable reason for
        failing to submit an assignment. Good times to make back ups are
        each time you finish work for a particular day, and just prior
        to making major changes in your programs. <br>
      </p>
      <hr> <a name="exams"></a> <b>Exams</b>
      <p>There will be two 50-minute in-class (hand-written) exams and
        two 120-minute lab exams. See the <a
          href="syllabus.html#requirements">Course Requirements</a>
        above for the dates of these exams. Except in truly exceptional
        circumstances, discussed with your instructor <i>prior</i> to
        missing an exam, neither in-class nor lab exams will be
        rescheduled. </p>
      <p> Because of the hierarchical nature of computer science as a
        discipline --- with each new concept building on the carefully
        constructed logical edifice of all that has come before it ---
        the exams for this course will necessarily be cumulative. You
        may expect, however, that all exams for this course except
        perhaps the final exam will emphasize the course material most
        recently covered. </p>
      <p><b>Conditions for in-class written exams</b>: Each in-class
        exam is 50 minutes long. Each student may bring into the exam a
        single sheet of standard letter-sized paper containing notes on
        one side.
        <!--
letter-sized paper containing <I>hand-written</I> notes on one side.  
You must write the notes yourself, and they must be originals not
photocopies. 
-->Apart from this single sheet of paper, no notes or materials of any
        kind may be consulted during the exam. In addition, no
        electronic devices of any kind, including calculators or cell
        phones, may be used. It is highly advisable to include reasoning
        or working in all exam answers, as partial credit for incorrect
        answers can only be given if your work demonstrates a correct
        understanding of the concepts being examined. </p>
      <p><b>Conditions for lab exams</b>: The lab exams will be held
        during regularly-scheduled lab periods. In these exams you will
        be asked to write Java program code on the computer. You may
        bring any written material you like to the exam, and you may
        access materials in your own file system and on the course web
        pages during the exam. However, you may not access external
        websites, and you may not communicate with other people during
        the exam (except the instructor) by any means. </p>

      <hr> <a name="keys"></a> <b>The Key To Success</b>
      <p> The single most important thing that you can do to succeed in
        this course is to do a little bit of work each night. Do not
        wait to start a homework assignment until the night before it is
        due! The <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/resources/bulletin/Academic-Policies-and-Procedures">Dickinson
College

          Bulletin</a> states "Credit for courses is based on the
        assumption that at least three hours of study accompany each
        class period (excluding labs)." That means that if you wait
        until the night before the week's homework is due, you could
        quite easily have 9 or more hours of work to do. A much better
        approach, as stated above, is to do a little bit of work each
        night. </p>
      <p> The assignments for this course are structured in a way that
        is designed to help you do a little bit of work each night.
        There is an individual web page for each class day. This page
        contains the reading assignment for that day, several practice
        exercises related to the material covered in class and in the
        reading and also the assigned homework questions. A good
        strategy is to do the reading and attempt the practice exercises
        during the evening following the class period. (Okay, you can do
        them on Saturday instead of on Friday night!) Then attempt the
        homework questions the following evening. </p>
      <p> Doing a little work each night using the strategy just
        described has several benefits. First, doing the reading and
        practice exercises right away means that the material from class
        is fresh in your mind. It also means that if you still find
        something confusing after both the class and the reading, or if
        you find the practice exercises difficult, you will have time to
        consult with a TA or with your professor before attempting the
        homework questions the next night. Talking with a TA or with
        your professor for 10 or 15 minutes could save you hours of
        struggling with a problem that has you stumped. Thus, by working
        a little bit each night you will usually complete the work for
        this course in much less time and with much less frustration
        than by attempting to do the work all on the night before it is
        due. You will also learn the material more thoroughly as you go,
        thus reducing the amount of time that you will need to spend
        studying for the exams. </p>
      <hr> <a name="availability"></a> <b>Lab Availability</b>
      <p> In the Tome building, Rooms 118, 122, 231 and 232 are Mac
        OS X labs that are configured with the necessary software for
        COMP 131. These labs are available whenever the Tome building is
        open, except when scheduled for classes. Room 118 is staffed
        with a Teaching Assistant (TA) who should be able to help you
        with COMP 131 material from 8:00PM -- 11:00PM Sunday through
        Thursday. </p>
      <hr> <a name="integrity"></a> <b>Academic Integrity</b>
      <p>Please take the time to read Dickinson's policy on cheating and
        plagiarism contained in the <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/student-life/resources/dean-of-students/content/Community-Standards/#Academic%20Misconduct">Community

          Standards</a> document. Violations of this policy are
        considered serious transgressions, so you should be especially
        certain that you understand your rights and responsibilities
        under it. Students suspected of academic dishonesty will be
        subject to the <b>Formal Resolution</b> process outlined <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/student-life/resources/dean-of-students/content/Community-Standards/#Procedures%20for%20Adjudicating%20Misconduct">here</a>;
        those found guilty will be subject to disciplinary action and
        likely earn a failing grade in the course. If you are unsure
        about whether or not certain kinds of collaboration are
        permissible, ask your instructor. </p>
      <p> <b>Homework Collaboration Policy</b> </p>
      <p>Any homework you submit for evaluation must be your own. This
        means that any work you submit for evaluation must have been
        developed by you and must have been written by you. Although you
        should feel free to discuss strategies and approaches to
        assigned work with your instructor, the TAs, and/or your
        classmates, you must always write up your solutions <i>alone</i>.
      </p>
      <p>To avoid inadvertently cheating --- or even the <i>appearance</i>
        of cheating --- you should not write anything down when you are
        discussing individual work with other students. If you have
        truly understood the ideas discussed, then you should have no
        difficulty reconstructing them, incorporating them into your
        solution, and writing up that solution, all on your own. </p>
      <p>When completing homework for this course, under no
        circumstances should you show another student any program code
        that belongs to you or have in your possession code that belongs
        to another student. </p>
      <p>If you consult classmates or other sources besides your
        instructor in completing any work for this course, then you are
        obligated to acknowledge your debt to these sources <i>in
          writing</i> as part of your problem solutions. Please be as
        specific as possible when acknowledging a source. You might say,
        for example, "I talked with X when working on Problem 3" or "I
        incorporated Y's idea about Z in my solution to Problem 5."
        Proper acknowledgment will not negatively affect your grade,
        although failure to provide it may.
        <!--
 No other student should
ever look at your computer screen, or at a printout or an electronic
copy of any program of yours, or at any code written by you by hand. In
particular, all help writing and debugging individual programs must
come from your instructor or a TA. 
--></p>
      <p> <b>Lab Collaboration Policy</b> </p>
      <p> You will be assigned a lab partner for each lab session. You
        and your lab partner should work together on the lab assignment
        and submit a single solution with both of your names on it. You
        should not collaborate with students (or others) outside your
        pair when working on lab assignments. </p>
      <p>You should feel free to incorporate into your solutions code
        that appears in the labs or on the course web site, provided you
        indicate that the code is not your own and where you got it
        from. You may incorporate <i>no</i> other code into your
        solutions. In particular, neither code written by students who
        have previously taken the course, code from other texts or other
        instructors, code from friends or relatives, nor code downloaded
        from the Internet may be incorporated into your solutions. </p>
      <hr> <a name="disab"></a> <b>Accommodations for Disabilities</b>
      <!--- statement provided by Disability Services 8/23/11 --->
      <p> Dickinson College makes reasonable academic accommodations for
        students with documented disabilities. I am available to discuss
        the implementation of those accommodations. Students requesting
        accommodations must first register with Disability Services to
        verify their eligibility. After documentation review, Marni
        Jones, Director of Learning Skills and Disability Services, will
        provide eligible students with accommodation letters for their
        professors. Students must obtain a new letter every semester and
        meet with each relevant professor prior to any accommodations
        being implemented. These meetings should occur during the first
        three weeks of the semester (except for unusual circumstances),
        and at least one week before any testing accommodations.
        Disability Services is located in Biddle House. Address
