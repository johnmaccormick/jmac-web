</font>

<p>Download and unpack the <a href="Golf.zip"><i>Golf</i> project</a>, and complete the implementation of the <code>GolfScoreCard</code> class as specified in the documentation for that class. The javadoc comment at the beginning of the class provides a general description of the class, and each method and constructor has a detailed comment. You must declare the fields and implement the constructor and all of the methods for the class. You must also create a test class and write test cases that achieve statement coverage for the constructor and all of the methods that you have defined. In addition, your tests should follow the "Testing Rules" outlined in class.

<p>Note that the <code>GolfScoreCard</code> is a fixed size collection of integer values representing the score that a golfer made on each hole.  Thus, you should implement this class using an array and not using an <code>ArrayList</code>.

<p> You may submit your solution to this practice exam
via WebCAT.  During the actual exam you will be
allowed to submit your solution as many times as you
like within the two hours allotted. Feedback from
submitting this practice exam will be similar to the
feedback that you will receive during the exam.
