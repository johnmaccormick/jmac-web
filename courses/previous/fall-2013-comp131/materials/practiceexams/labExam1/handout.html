<p>

  Download and unpack the
  <a href="PostalRateCalculator.zip"><i>Postal Rate Calculator</i> project</a>,
  and complete the implementation of the 
 <code>RateCalculator</code>
 class as specified in the documentation for that class.
 The javadoc comment at the beginning of the class
 provides a general description of the class, and each method and
 constructor has a detailed comment.
 You must declare the fields and implement
 the constructor and all of the methods for the class.
 You must also create a test class and write test cases that achieve
 statement coverage for the constructor and all of the methods that you
 have defined.
<p>
 You may submit your solution to this practice exam via WebCAT.  During the actual exam you will be allowed to submit your solution as many times as you like within the two hours allotted. Feedback from submitting this practice exam will be similar to the feedback that you will receive during the exam.  However, the actual exam will also include an instructor portion of the grade, which is not included in the practice exam.

<!--<p>-->
<!--quick fix to submit: 1. download the file <a href="submitter.zip"><i>submitter.zip</i></a>. 2. unzip it, which gives you a file called "submitter.properties".  3. copy this file into the folder containing your BlueJ postal rate calculator (wiping out the copy of "submitter.properties" that is already in that folder)-->
