<h3>Exam 1</h3>


<ul>
  <li><b>Content:</b> This exam will cover classes 1-9 inclusive.
  About half of the exam will be on technical topics (password
  security and cryptography), and about half will be on geopolitical
  topics (information security basics, and the content of our Clarke
  and Knake text).  Anything covered in class or in any assigned
  reading is eligible to be examined. In practice, however, a strong
  majority of questions will be similar to homework
  questions.
  <li><b>Style of questions:</b> The exam will be a mix of true-false
  questions, short-answer questions, 2-3-sentence questions, and
  calculation questions.  For calculation questions, show your
  reasoning so that you can be awarded partial credit if you get the
  answer wrong.
  <li><b>Permitted materials:</b> As stated on the syllabus, no
  materials or electronic devices are permitted during the exam, with
  the following exception: you may bring in three sheets of standard
  letter-size paper, with written notes on both sides of the three
  sheets.  The notes must be written by you in your own handwriting;
  typed notes are not permitted.
  <li><b>How to prepare:</b> The best way to prepare for the exam is
  to ensure you can effortlessly answer all homework questions,
  without referring to any materials.  In addition, you should be
  familiar with the main points of every chapter of Clarke and Knake.
</ul>

<h3>Exam 2</h3>

<P>This exam will cover classes 10-25 inclusive.  Most other aspects
of the exam are similar to Exam 1, described above.  In particular,
you may bring in three pages of handwritten notes (both sides).
Questions will be approximately half on technical material, and half
on geo-political material.  A majority of questions will be similar to
homework questions.
