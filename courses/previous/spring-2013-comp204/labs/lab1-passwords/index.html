    <h2>Password lab</h2>

This lab provides a superficial investigation into how quickly a
computer can crack different types of passwords. The password-cracking
method used here is the simplest possible type of attack: the computer
just randomly guesses possible passwords until it finds the right one.

The lab may be completed in teams of two, so you may collaborate with
your team members on the answers to homework questions for this class.
To complete the lab, please perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>Familiarize yourself with how
  to <a href="../python-overview.html">execute and edit Python
  programs</a>.
  <li>Download the <a href="password-lab.zip">password lab zip
  file</a>, and unzip it (by double-clicking it) into a new folder somewhere.
  <li><b>Cracking numeric passwords:</b> We first investigate the
  cracking of numeric passwords (i.e. passwords that consist only of
  numeric digits, like "34259"). The program <tt>guess-numeric.py</tt>
  accepts one commandline argument specifying the number of digits in
  your password.  For example, the command <tt>python guess-numeric.py 6</tt>
  will ask you to enter a six-digit numeric password. It then tries to
  guess your password (by randomly selecting six-digit numbers until
  it finds the right one) and tells you how long it took to do so.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Activity:</b> By repeatedly
      running <tt>guess-numeric.py</tt> with different inputs, and
      recording the results, estimate the average time required to
      crack numeric passwords of length 5, 6, and 7.  
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.1:</b> State the average times you
      recorded in the previous activity, for lengths 5, 6, and 7.
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.2:</b> By approximately what factor
      does the time taken to guess the password increase, whenever an
      extra digit is added to the length of the password?
    </ul>
  <li><b>Cracking alphabetic passwords:</b> Next we investigate the
  cracking of lowercase alphabetic passwords (i.e. passwords that
  consist only of the lowercase letters a-z, like "fudjfdo"). The
  program <tt>guess-alphabetic.py</tt> accepts one commandline
  argument specifying the number of letters in your password.  For
  example, the command <tt>python guess-alphabetic.py 6</tt> will ask you
  to enter a six-letter lowercase password. It then tries to guess
  your password (by randomly selecting six-letter strings until it
  finds the right one) and tells you how long it took to do so.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Activity:</b> By repeatedly
      running <tt>guess-alphabetic.py</tt> with different inputs, and
      recording the results, estimate the average time required to
      crack numeric passwords of length 4 and 5.  (If it's taking a long time, note that you can run multiple experiments simultaneously by opening up new Terminal windows.)
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.3:</b> State the average times you
      recorded in the previous activity, for lengths 4 and 5.
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.4:</b> By approximately what factor
      does the time taken to guess the password increase, when you
      lengthen the password from 4 characters to 5 characters?
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.5:</b> By approximately what factor
      does the time taken to guess the password increase, when you
      switch from a 5-digit numeric password to a 5-character
      alphabetic password?
    </ul>
  <li><b>(Optional) Cracking dictionary word passwords:</b> Next we investigate
  the cracking of passwords that are words in English
  (e.g. "dog"). The program <tt>guess-word.py</tt> requires no
  commandline arguments.  It loads a dictionary of about 250,000
  English words, and asks you to enter an English word as your
  password. It then tries to guess your password (by randomly
  selecting words from its dictionary until it finds the right one)
  and tells you how long it took to do so.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Activity:</b> By repeatedly
      running <tt>guess-word.py</tt> with different inputs, and
      recording the results, estimate the average time required to
      crack dictionary word passwords.
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.6:</b> State the average time you
      recorded in the previous activity.
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.7:</b> By approximately what factor
      does the time taken to guess the password increase, when you
      switch from a dictionary word password to a 5-character
      alphabetic password?
      <li><b>Discussion question A:</b> (Discussion questions are not
      graded and you do not have to submit the answer. Please just
      write down your answer somewhere so that we can discuss it in
      class.)  There seems to be a paradox here. If we use the same
      5-character alphabetic password "robot" as input
      to <tt>guess-word.py</tt> and <tt>guess-alphabetic.py</tt>, the
      results are very different. Why do we get such different results
      when using exactly the same password?
    </ul>
  <li><b>(Optional) Cracking word+digit passwords:</b> Next we investigate the
  cracking of passwords that consist of an English word followed by a
  single digit (e.g. "tree7"). The
  program <tt>guess-word-and-digit.py</tt> requires no commandline
  arguments.  It loads a dictionary of about 250,000 English words,
  and asks you to enter an English word plus one digit as your
  password. It then tries to guess your password (by randomly
  selecting words from its dictionary followed by a random digit, until
  it finds the right combination) and tells you how long it took to do
  so.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Activity:</b> By repeatedly
      running <tt>guess-word-and-digit.py</tt> with different inputs,
      and recording the results, estimate the average time required to
      crack word+digit passwords.
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.8:</b> State the average time you
      recorded in the previous activity.
      <li><b>Homework exercise 1.9:</b> By approximately what factor
      does the time taken to guess the password increase, when you
      switch from a dictionary word password to a word+digit password?
      <li><b>Discussion question B:</b> Which is the most secure of
      all the types of passwords investigated in this lab?  Which is
      the least secure?
      <li><b>Discussion question C:</b> What high-level lesson did you
      learn from this lab, if anything?
    </ul>
  <li><b>(Optional) Cracking word+2digits passwords:</b> (This part of
  the lab is optional.  No extra credit is available.) Save the
  file <tt>guess-word-and-digit.py</tt> as a new file
  called <tt>guess-word-and-2digits.py</tt>.  Now edit your new file
  so that it guesses passwords consisting of a dictionary word plus 2
  digits (e.g. "robot73").  Hint: you should only need to change the
  lines in the file marked with "#####".  Once you have made the
  necessary changes, run the new program and determine approximately
  how much longer it takes to guess these word+2digits passwords,
  compared to the word+digit passwords.
