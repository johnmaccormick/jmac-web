<P>Required reading:
<ul>
  <li>The course syllabus
  <li>Chapter 1 of Clarke and Knake.  Make a few notes (say, 50-100
  words) for discussion in Class 4.  Retain your notes and submit them
  as part of homework assignment 1. (The notes may be handwritten.)

  <li>Skim over the following interesting blog
  post: <a href="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html">PIN
  analysis</a>, by Nick Berry, September 2012.
</ul>

<P>Lecture notes: <a href="password-security-v2.pdf">password-security-v2.pdf</a>.


<P>Homework questions:
<ul>
  <li>For the purposes of these exercises, assume that a modern desktop
  computer can compute 10^5 password hashes per second.  Also assume
  that the age of the universe is 10^18 seconds. (This is 13 billion
  years, rounded up to the nearest power of 10.)
  <li><b>Homework exercise 2.1:</b> (a) What is the SHA-256 hash value
  of the password "foo6wom3bat9"? (b) How about "foo6wom4bat9"?
  <li><b>Homework exercise 2.2:</b> How long would it take, on
  average, for a modern desktop computer to crack a numeric password
  that is the seven digits long, given a hash of the password?
  <li><b>Homework exercise 2.3:</b> How long would it take, on
  average, for a modern desktop computer to crack an alphanumeric
  password (including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and
  digits) that is ten characters long, given a hash of the password?
  <li><b>Homework exercise 2.4:</b>A computer administrator decides
  that all passwords on a certain system must take longer to crack, on
  average, than the age of the universe (assuming the cracking is done
  by a modern desktop computer).  Suppose that all users on the system
  will choose genuinely random alphanumeric passwords (including
  uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits).  How long do the
  passwords need to be in order to meet the security guideline set by
  the administrator?
  <li><b>Homework exercise 2.5:</b>Suppose a college IT system has
  5000 users.  The vast majority of users choose strong passwords, but
  1% of users use passwords that are present in a standard English
  dictionary of 50,000 words. A malicious hacker has obtained the
  password hashes of all 5000 users. How long would it take, on
  average, for the hacker to obtain one of the passwords on this
  system using a dictionary attack?

with the authors).  The
randomly-generated <a href="class-4-groups.html">list of the
discussion groups</a> is available.  The first person listed in each
group (in bold) is responsible for chairing the discussion (20
minutes), and for presenting the results (10 minutes) to the class

pointing this out; as he says, it "detail[s] extensive hacking of
their systems by Chinese hackers since they published their
investigation into Wen Jiabao's family in October."  Here's another

<h3><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 6 (Thursday, February 7): Public-key cryptography</FONT></h3>

<P>Required reading:
<ul>
  <li>The remainder of Chapter 4 of "9 Algorithms That Changed the
  Future" (available on Moodle).
  <li>First half of Chapter 6 of Clarke and Knake.  Make a few notes
  (say, 50-100 words) for discussion in Class 9. Retain your notes and
  submit them as part of homework assignment 3. (The notes may be
  handwritten.)
</ul>

<P>Lecture notes for
today: <a href="public-key-crypto-v1.pdf">public-key-crypto-v1.pdf</a>;
additional examples are available on the public key crypto
handout, <a href="cryptography-examples-v3.pdf">cryptography-examples-v3.pdf</a>.


<P>YouTube video by Chris Bishop, demonstrating
a <a href="http://youtu.be/U62S8SchxX4">key exchange algorithm using
physical keys and padlocks</a>. In fact, the algorithm demonstrated
here is not analogous to the Diffie-Hellman scheme we study in class
-- but it is a very interesting example of the surprising types of
secure communication that are possible over a public channel.

<P>Homework questions:
<ul>
  <li><b>Homework exercise 6.1:</b> <br>Using the paint-color analogy
  for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, suppose that Alice's private color
  is purple, Bob's private color is charcoal, and the public color is
  maroon. 
    <ul>
      <li>(a) What mixture does Bob transmit to Alice during the key
  exchange?
      <li>(b) What mixture becomes the shared secret mixture?
    </ul>
  <li><b>Homework exercise 6.2:</b> <br>Suppose Alice and Bob perform
  a Diffie-Hellman key exchange with modulus 7 and base 3.  Alice's
  private number is 2, and Bob's private number is 6.  
    <ul>
      <li>(a) What number does Alice transmit to Bob during the key
  exchange?
      <li>(b) What is the resulting shared secret key?
    </ul>
  <li><b>Homework exercise 6.3:</b> <br>Alice and Bob use RSA
  cryptography, with the keys specified on the accompanying handout
  (see link above)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>(a) Alice encrypts the plaintext number 9 for sending to
  Bob. What is the ciphertext?
      <li>(b) Bob encrypts the same plaintext number 9 for sending to
  Alice. What is the ciphertext?
      <li>(c) In a single sentence of your own words, explain why your
  answers to (a) and (b) are different, even though the plaintext
  message was the same in both cases.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Homework exercise 6.4:</b> <br>Using the same system and keys
  as the previous question, Bob receives the ciphertext 3 from
  Alice. What was the plaintext?
</ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 7 (Tuesday, February 12): Digital signatures</FONT></h3>

<P>Required reading:
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 9 of "9 Algorithms That Changed the
  Future" (available on Moodle).
  <li>Second half of Chapter 6 of Clarke and Knake.  Make a few notes
  (say, 50-100 words) for discussion in Class 9. Retain your notes and
  submit them as part of homework assignment 3. (The notes may be
  handwritten.)
</ul>

<P>Lecture notes for
today: <a href="digital-signatures-v1.pdf">digital-signatures-v1.pdf</a>.

<P>Homework questions:  
<ul>
  <li>These questions use the keys on the public key crypto handout
  linked above.  When a hash function is required, use the hash
  function <i>h</i> described on the handout.  When a digital
  signature is required, use an RSA signature.  Unless otherwise
  stated, any message should be hashed before it is signed.  All
  messages are sent using 2-digit blocks, and signatures are appended
  as an additional 2-digit block.
  <li><b>Homework exercise <s>6.1</s> 7.1:</b> <br>Alice would like to send the
  message 15 to Bob, without any encryption or hashing, but with a
  digital signature.  What is actually sent?
  <li><b>Homework exercise <s>6.2</s> 7.2:</b> <br>Bob would like to send the
  message 091406 to Alice, with encryption and a digital signature.
  What is actually sent?
  <li><b>Homework exercise <s>6.3</s> 7.3:</b> <br>Bob receives the unencrypted,
  signed message 02091813, claiming to be from Alice.  (a) Did Alice
  send the message? (b) Was the message tampered with?
  <li><b>Homework exercise <s>6.4</s> 7.4:</b> <br>Bob receives the unencrypted,
  signed message 13291709, claiming to be from Alice.  (a) Did Alice
  send the message? (b) Was the message tampered with?
  <li><b>Homework exercise <s>6.5</s> 7.5:</b> <br>Use some quick web research to
  find a news report about a Certificate Authority issuing a bogus
  certificate. You may not use the same incident described by the link
  at the end of today's lecture notes (a google.com certificate issued
  by TURKTRUST).  Describe the incident you found in one or two
  sentences of your own words. There is no need to cite your source.
