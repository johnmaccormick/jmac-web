    <h2>Hackers and hacktivists</h2>

Dan Appello submitted the following interesting content about hackers
and hacktivists:

<blockquote>
<P>I found an interesting interview with the hacking group, 3xp1r3, that I figured I would share. It's with one of their top members, sYs, who answers some questions such as what got him into hacking and the inner workings of a hacking group. The article is:

<P>Another interesting site is a database displaying statistics of all hacked websites by different groups and teams. It's really interesting to see it's almost like a sport to these hackers where groups are ranked and points are given to successfully hacks.  I'm linking 3xp1r3's statistics specifically but many other groups can be viewed:

<P>An example of what they do to websites is here:
