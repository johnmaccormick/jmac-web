<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 8: Thursday, September 19</FONT></h4>


<P>There are no lecture notes for today.  Please take your own notes
in class.  You need to understand the basics of references and goto
statements in C++, even though none of the programming assignments
requires these.  You also need to understand what operator overloading
means, but you aren't required to learn the syntax. Please see the
example code below for references, goto statements, and operator
overloading:
<ul>
  <li><a href="references.cpp">references.cpp</a>
  <li><a href="operator-overload.cpp">operator-overload.cpp</a>
  <li><a href="goto.cpp">goto.cpp</a>
</ul>

<P>In addition, you should be aware of the content of Dijkstra's 1968
discussion of go to statements and structured programming, <i>Go To
Statement Considered Harmful</i> (available on Moodle).  We will read
and discuss this famous letter to the editor in class.  Wikipedia has
an excellent article on
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto_statement">goto
statement</a>.  Interestingly, there is a separate Wikipedia page
devoted to the phrase
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">considered
harmful</a>".

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 12: Thursday, October 3</FONT></h4>

Exam 1.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 13: Monday, October 7</FONT></h4>

<P>Lecture notes will not be provided for most of this topic. We will
stick reasonably closely to the textbook (Chapter 15, sections 0-5 and
section 11 are the only ones we will cover).

<P>Instructions for editing and running Scheme programs:
<ul>
  <li>To launch the right program:<ul>
      <li>On the Tome Macs: run Applications | PLT Scheme v4.2 |
  DrScheme.
	<li>On your own machine: download the latest version
  of <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">DrRacket</a> and run it.
	</ul> 
  <li>Always set your language to "Advanced Student": go to Language |
  Choose language | How to Design Programs | Advanced Student.
   <li>To test that it works: use the File menu to create a new file,
   put some simple Scheme into it, such as "(+ 3 4)", save the file,
   then click Run.  You should see the output in the Interaction
   Window.
  <li>[with thanks to Cooper Jackson for this useful tip] For
  debugging complicated list structures, it helps to turn off the
  display feature known as "sharing".  To do this, select the
  "Advanced Student" language as described above, then click "Show
  Details", then uncheck the option for "Show sharing in values".
    </ul>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 14: Thursday, October 10</FONT></h4>

This class involves interactive exercises using lambda expressions, lists, quote, let, and recursion. Please read textbook sections 15.5.8-15.5.11 and 6.9.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 15: Monday, October 14</FONT></h4>

<P>Please read textbook sections 15.5.12-14.

<P>For more detailed examples, see the <a href="tail-recursion-handout.txt">tail recursion handout.</a>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 16: Thursday, October 17</FONT></h4>

<P>Please take the <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/cs-major-survey.html">CS majors' survey</a>, if you haven't done so already.

<P>Lecture notes on the <a href="c16-scheme-implementation-notes.pdf">implementation of Scheme</a>.

<P>Do you find Scheme's use of parentheses are little excessive? Check
out the <a href="smith-scheme-book-contents.pdf">contents page of the
book <i>Introduction to Scheme</i></a>, by Jerry Smith.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 17: Monday, October 21</FONT></h4>

<P>Fall pause -- no class.


<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 18: Thursday, October 24</FONT></h4>

<P>Please take the <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5R8B9XJ">class survey</a>.

<P>Most of the class will be a discussion of section 15.11 in the
textbook.  It may also be useful to browse a few of the hits on a web
search for
"<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=functional+vs+imperative">functional
versus imperative</a>".

<P>This class will also include some lab time to work on and ask
questions about homework assignment 7.

<P>If you have finished the homework, I recommend working on
the <a href="extra-exercises-from-dybvig.pdf">optional exercises</a>,
taken from Dybvig's book, <i>The Scheme Programming Language</i>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 19: Monday, October 28</FONT></h4>

<P>This class covers <b>non-examinable</b> topics: assignments in
Scheme, object-oriented approaches in Scheme, vectors and hash tables
in Scheme,
and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397687.aspx">delegates
and lambda expressions in C&#35;</a>.
Some <a href="c19-examples.zip">example Scheme code</a> is available
(note that this uses the Racket language, not the Advanced Student
language we used for all our previous work).

<P>This class will also include some lab time to work on and ask
questions about homework assignment 7.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 20: Thursday, October 31</FONT></h4>

<P>This class covers sections 5.1-5.4 and 6.12-6.14 of the textbook.

<P>Contrast the textbook's definition of <i>strongly typed</i> with the discussion given in the first answer on the following page: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/430182/is-c-strongly-typed">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/430182/is-c-strongly-typed</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 21: Monday, November 4</FONT></h4>

<P>Exam 2.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 22: Thursday, November 7</FONT></h4>

<P>This class covers sections 5.5-5.8 of the textbook, but sections
5.5.6 and 5.5.7 are excluded.  (These sections cover dynamic scoping,
which we will discuss in class, but which will not be included in any
homework or exam questions.)

<P>The brief code examples used in class are available
as <a href="scope-examples.zip">scope-examples.zip</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 23: Monday, November 11</FONT></h4>

<P>For running Prolog programs:
<ul>
  <li>On the Tome Macs, use XGP, located in Applications | XGP. See detailed <a href="xgp-instructions.html">instructions for using XGP</a>.
  <li>You are welcome to run Prolog on your own machine; I find
   <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a> to be the most
convenient.  But I can't devote any resources to troubleshooting
problems on your own machine. If you encounter any problems that you
cannot solve on your own, please use the Tome Macs instead.
</ul>

<P>We will follow the textbook closely for this topic. Separate
lecture notes will not be provided (mostly).  However, the examples
used in class today are available
as <a href="course.pl">course.pl</a>.

<P>The textbook uses unusual notation for some of the propositional
logic operators (and, or, implies).  We will use the standard notation
as taught in the Dickinson discrete math course.

<P>Some of the in-class examples are taken
from <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog</a>

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 24: Thursday, November 14</FONT></h4>

<P>Lecture notes on <a href="c24-prolog-and-FOL.pdf">prolog and
first-order logic</a>.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 25: Monday, November 18</FONT></h4>

<P>Some very brief <a href="unification-notes.pdf">notes on unification</a>.

<P>We do not study the use of arithmetic in Prolog (so you can skip
the book section 16.6.6).

<P>The file <a href="course-inference.pl">course-inference.pl</a>
contains the example used to explain the inference in Prolog.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 26: Thursday, November 21</FONT></h4>

<P>Instructions for using tracing facilities with XGP:
<ul>
  <li>These instructions use the
  file <a href="course-inference.pl">course-inference.pl</a> as an
  example.  We assume you would like to trace the query <code>
      teachingStudent(maccormick,gao).
      </code>
  <li>Consult the file course-inference.pl, then evaluate the query
  "trace, teachingStudent(maccormick,gao)."
  <li>In the XGP Console window, repeatedly press the Enter key to
  step through the evaluation.
  <li>To terminate tracing, enter "n" (followed by Enter) in the XGP Console window.
</ul>

<P>The main topic for today is covered in section 16.7 of the
textbook.  Some <a href="c26-prolog-additional-notes.pdf">brief
additional notes on Prolog</a> are provided.  The accompanying
file <a href="tree.pl">tree.pl</a> demonstrates a non-trivial Prolog
data structure.

<h4><FONT COLOR="000066">Class 27: Monday, December 2</FONT></h4>

<P>Continue working on final project in class.

<P>Earlier in the semester, I briefly discussed the recently-published
paper from a bunch of MIT
researchers: <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2517349.2522728">Towards
Optimization-Safe Systems: Analyzing the Impact of Undefined
Behavior</a>, by Xi Wang, Nickolai Zeldovich, M. Frans Kaashoek,
Armando
Solar-Lezama. Some <a href="http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp13/talks/wang_stack_se05_04.pdf">slides</a>
used by the first author when presenting the paper are also available.
Note the puzzle on the last page of the slides -- it is highly
relevant to this class!  A file containing the relevant code from the
puzzle is available: <a href="puzzle.c">puzzle.c</a>.
