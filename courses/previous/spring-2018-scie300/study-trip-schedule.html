Free day to spend as you wish. If the weather is nice, I may lead a
hike up Arthur's Seat. If you feel like taking the train to another
spectacular castle, Stirling Castle is a good option. For
royal-watchers, the Royal Yacht Britannia should be very interesting.

day within the next three weeks (valid on off-peak trains only). If
traveling today, one possibility is depart Edinburgh 11 AM arrive
