    <H3>Academic expectations for travel and classroom activities</H3>

    <P>This course consists of several different kinds of learning
    opportunities, including typical classroom sessions, day-long
    excursions, and a week-long study trip. Every visit, tour, or other
    activity, whether inside or outside the classroom, will be
    considered an
    <i>academic event</i>. You will receive a PAE grade for every
    academic event, based on appropriate behavior and performance
    including the following minimal requirements.
    <ul>
      <li>Please bring a notebook and pencil or pen to every academic
    event. (Exception: these are not required for purely social or
    cultural events.) Use your notebook to take a reasonable quantity
    of notes during academic events. There are several reasons for
    this, including: taking notes will help you concentrate and learn
    more effectively, and you will be allowed to refer to your notes
    in pop quizzes. During classroom sessions, you may use a tablet or
    laptop except during quizzes.
      <li>Phones must be silenced and put away at all times during
    academic events, including classroom sessions. The following
    additional comments apply to use of phones in academic events
    outside the classroom:
	<ul>
	  <li>Please don't take notes on your phone; that's what your
	    notebook is for.
	  <li>Please don't look up information on your phone, even if
    it is academically relevant. Instead, make a note in your notebook
	    and look up the information later.
	  <li>Exception: At times and places where it is clearly
	    okay to do so, you can use your phone to take a photo. Then
	    immediately put it away again.
	</ul>
      <li>Please do not be late for academic events.
      <li>In addition to the notebook and pencil or pen, please bring
    each of the following items to academic events that take place
    outside the classroom: cash, emergency card, phone that is charged
    and topped up with sufficient minutes and texts.
	</ul>

    <H3>PAE (Participation, Attendance, and Engagement)</H3>

    PAE grades will be awarded for several types of activities in the
    course, including academic events, quizzes, and Moodle discussion
    groups. In most cases, a PAE grade will be awarded on a scale of
    0-3, where 2 is the typical score. Don't think of your score as a
    percentage. Good performance will usually receive a 2.0, and you
    should expect to receive that score most of the
    time. Exceptionally strong performance will receive a score
    between 2.0 and 3.0. Performance that does not meet all
    expectations will receive a score between 0.0 and 2.0.

    <H3>Quizzes</H3>

    Brief quizzes will take place periodically, usually consisting of
    3-6 short-answer questions and lasting only 5-10
    minutes. Quizzes will usually be given before, after, or during
    academic events.  You can write your answers to the quiz on a
    blank sheet in your notebook, then tear out the sheet and give it
    to the instructor. 

    <P>During a quiz, you may refer to any hand-written notes in
    your notebook, but you may not refer to any other information.

    <P>Quiz questions could address any reasonable academic content,
    such as required readings and information from academic
    events. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you take
    a reasonable quantity of notes in your notebook for every assigned
      reading and academic event.

      <P>The intention of the quizzes is to provide an incentive to
      take readings and academic events seriously. Don't be anxious or
      concerned about the quizzes. Questions will not be obscure or
      unreasonable. If you have done the reading and taken sensible
      notes on the most important points, and if you take sensible
      notes at academic events, then you'll have no trouble with the
      quizzes.
