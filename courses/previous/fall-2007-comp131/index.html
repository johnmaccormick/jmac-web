    <h1>COMP131, Computer Science I, Section 2 (John MacCormick's section)</h1>

    Please see the <A HREF="http://users.dickinson.edu/~cs131/">main
    COMP 131 website</A> for most details about the course.  This page
    lists only the information that is specific to Section 2 of the
    course, instructed by John MacCormick.

    <h3>Policy for late assignments</h3>

    Both homework and lab assignments have the same lateness policy.
    Each student is permitted a total of two no-penalty days of
    lateness over the entire semester; every subsequent day of
    lateness incurs a 25% penalty for the late assignment.  "Days of
    lateness" are computed by rounding up to the nearest whole number
    of 24-hour periods, so an assignment submitted one minute after
    the due time is regarded as being one day late, and an assignment
    submitted 27 hours after the due time is regarded as being two
    days late.

    <h3>Lab programming in pairs</h3>

    All lab assignments will be done in pairs assigned by the
    instructor.  The pairs will be different random pairings of
    students for each lab assignment.  During the lab classes,
    students will use standard <I>pair programming</I> technique, with
    one typing while the other assists (sometimes referred to as
    <I>driver</I> and <I>navigator</I>).  Students will switch roles
    every 15 minutes during class.  Obviously, unlimited collaboration
    is permitted between a pair of students working on an assignment.
    However, the collaboration policy described on the <A
    HREF="http://users.dickinson.edu/~cs131/">main
    COMP 131 website</A> still applies for any communication between
    different pairs of students.  In particular, never share any
    written or electronic information about a lab assignment with
    someone from another pair.

    Students have been divided into different, random pairings for
    each lab, as listed on the <A HREF="lab-partners.htm">lab pairings webpage</A>.

    <h3>Retaking lab exam 1</h3>

    Anyone who wishes to retake lab exam 1 as a take-home exam may do
    so, by following the instructions on the <A
    HREF="lab-exam1-retake/index.html">retake webpage</A>.  The deadline for
    submitting your retake is midnight on Sunday, October 21.  You
    must write all the code yourself, but you may ask a TA specific
    questions if you get stuck.  If you choose to submit a retake,
    your final grade for lab exam 1 will be the average of your
    original grade and your retake grade (although if you somehow
    manage to do worse on the retake, your original grade will stand).

    <h3>Results and action plan from mid-term survey</h3>

    The <A HREF="midterm-results.pdf">results from the mid-term
    survey</A> are available.  The main conclusion is that most people
    would like the lectures to be shorter with more time for practice
    exercises.  However, very few people want the explanations of
    lecture material to be <I>faster</I>.  Therefore, it will be
    difficult to compress the lectures much, but I will do my best.
    My main plan is to eliminate unnecessary examples and let the
    students work through them on their own.
