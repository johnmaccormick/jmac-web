    <h2>Lab Grading Criteria</h2>

As with homework assignments, lab grading will be based partially on
completeness and partially on correctness/quality. Only a subset of lab code
and lab reports will be graded for correctness/quality. The following criteria
specify how points will be awarded when correctness/quality is being assessed.
    
<p><b>Correctness:&nbsp; A measure of how well your program satisfies the requirements of the assignment.</b></p>
<p>This score will depend primarily on the performance of your program when run against a set of instructor JUnit test cases.&nbsp; For some assignments, it will also be necessary for the instructor to include manual test cases such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking that your code meets the specifications in the assignment (e.g. specific class names and method signatures).</li>
<li>Executing your program manually and checking that it performs all required operations correctly (if not fully tested by the instructor JUnit reference tests, e.g. GUI programs).</li>
<li>Inspecting your source code for bugs not easily uncovered by automated testing methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Code Quality:&nbsp;A measure of the style and efficiency of your program code.</b></p>
<p>This will include factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formatting:
<ul>
<li>Use of spacing and indentation to make code more readable.</li>
<li>Following Java convention for variableNames, methodNames, STATIC_VARIABLES, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation &amp; Readability:
<ul>
<li>Choice of descriptive class/method/variable/parameter names, etc.</li>
<li>Including Javadoc comments, with appropriate tags (e.g. @param, @return) on classes, constructors and methods.</li>
<li>Appropriate use of explanatory block and line comments within code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statement choice:
<ul>
<li>Appropriate statements are selected that enhance the semantic content of the code: use of for vs. while, nested vs cascading if/else, appropriate use of Boolean operators in conditions, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Efficiency:
<ul>
<li>Code does not perform unnecessary work or use unnecessary memory: no extraneous fields/variables/code, appropriate data type selections, proper use of static modifier, use of fields vs. local variables, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintainability:
<ul>
<li>Appropriate use of techniques to enhance reusability and maintainability of code: class constants, private helper methods, proper access modifiers, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Test Quality:</b>&nbsp;<b>A measure of how thoroughly you have tested your own code.</b></p>
<p>For labs that require JUnit tests, this score will be based on an examination of your submitted JUnit tests. &nbsp;The highest scores will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>That your code is tested thoroughly (all code is exercised, likely sources of errors are probed, boundary cases are tested, etc)</li>
<li>Each test checks a specific functionality and the purpose of each test is readily identifiable from the test method name and/or added comments.</li>
<li>Each test includes appropriate assertions with helpful failure messages.</li>
</ul>
