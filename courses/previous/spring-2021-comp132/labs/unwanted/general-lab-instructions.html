    <H2>General lab instructions</H2>

<h3>Installing required software</h3>
    
<P>For completing labs in this course, you will need to install the
following two pieces of software on your computer (or if you are on
campus, you can use the computers in the Tome building, which already
have the necessary software installed):
    <ul>
      <li>A Java development kit (JDK). The specific recommendation
      for this course is openjdk 11 with the Hotspot VM (virtual
      machine), available
      from <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">adoptopenjdk.net</a>. Other
      JDK's should also work fine.
      <li>The Eclipse IDE (integrated development environment),
      available
      from <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse.org</a>.
    </ul>
    Install the two tools above before continuing.

<h3>Obtaining starter code and creating Git repository</h3>
    
<P>Unless stated otherwise, the following instructions apply to each lab:
    <UL>
      <li>Copy the starter code link, available from the course "Labs"
      webpage.
      <li>Log into your GitHub account and paste the starter code link
      in the address bar of the same window you used to log in to
      GitHub.
      <li>You will see a message to accept an assignment. Once you
      accept the assignment, GitHub will provide you with a link that
      you can use to access the code repository for the lab.
      <li>On the GitHub webpage for the starter code repository, click
      the green Code button, and copy the web URL for "clone with HTTPS".
      <li>Open Eclipse.
      <li>Go to Window -> Show View -> Other -> Git -> Git
      Repositories. A Git Repositories view should appear below the
      Package Explorer.
      <li>In the Git Repositories view, click on "Clone a Git
      Repository and add the clone to this view". In the Window that
      opens up, paste the URL for the starter code repository (already
      copied above) into the URI field. Enter your GitHub username and
      password. Click Next and Finish. A Git clone should appear in
      the Git Repositories window.
      <li>Right click on the Git Repository and select Import Projects
      -> Finish.
      <li>A Java project should now appear in the Package Explorer tab
      in the left part of the Eclipse window.
    </UL>

<h3>Committing and pushing your changes to GitHub for backup and grading</h3>

In order to push your changes to the GitHub repository from Eclipse,
right click on the relevant Java project in the Git Repositories and
click on Commit.  Find the newly-appeared "Git Staging" window and
click on the double-plus symbol to move all of your changes from
"Unstaged Changes" to "Staged Changes". Type a descriptive commit
message into the Commit Message box (this can be useful later to
remind you of what changes you have made). Finally, click "Commit and
Push" followed by "Next", "Push", "Close". This saves all the changes
on your computer and also pushes them to the GitHub servers. This is a
good way to back up your progress, and it is also the way you will
submit code for grading. The instructor will grade the most
recently-committed version.

<h3>Creating new projects, packages, classes; running Java programs</h3>
    
<P>For detailed instructions on creating a new projects, packages, and
classes in Eclipse, and for running Java programs, see the
instructions for Lab 0.

<h3>Finding your source files to share with a lab partner</h3>
  
Note that Eclipse stores your .java files within a directory on your
computer. In most labs, you will be working with a lab partner. Most
often, you will work simultaneously with your partner via screen
sharing---so you will be working together on one set of
files. However, sometimes you will want to work individually and share
your progress with each other. There are many sophisticated ways of
collaborating on shared files, but in this course we use the simplest
possible approach: it is recommended that you simply email your .java
files to your partner (or share the files by any other filesharing
technique that you are comfortable with).

<P>Before you can do this, you will need to find your .java files
within the local file system on your computer. Within Eclipse, this is
achieved by right-clicking on the relevant .java file in Package
Explorer, then choose Show In | System Explorer. 
  

  
<h3>Submitting write-up document, including self-assessment report, to
 Moodle</h3>

For every lab, the source code will be submitted to a GitHub
repository as described above. In addition, however, for every lab
you will also be required to submit a <i>write-up document</i> to
Moodle. Some labs require you to collect and write about some results
as part of the lab itself, in which case those results would form part
of your write-up document. However, whether or not the lab explicitly
requires you to report on results, every write-up document must
contain a
<i>self-assessment report</i>. The self-assessment report is a very
brief summary of which parts of the lab you successfully completed,
together with descriptions of any parts that are incomplete or not
working correctly. Typically, the self-assessment report will be
between one and five sentences in length. It should take at most 10
minutes to write the report. The main purpose of the self-assessment
report is to help the instructor grade your work efficiently and
accurately while also creating the best possible opportunity for the
instructor to help you with problems you encountered. If you believe
you completed and tested all parts of the lab successfully, you can
state this in a single sentence. If not, briefly describe the parts
that are incomplete or not working correctly. Submit your write-up
document in PDF format to Moodle.
