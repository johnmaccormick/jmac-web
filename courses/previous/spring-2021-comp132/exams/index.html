As stated on the syllabus:
    
<blockquote>
"The midterm and final exams are open note and open web.  Students may
consult any printed or digital materials and may perform web
searches. However, no communication with other humans is permitted...
<P>Technically speaking, any material covered in any lecture, reading,
lab, or homework assignment is eligible to appear in the midterm or
final exams. In practice, most exam questions will be similar to a
homework question, an example done in class, or other assigned
practice questions...
<P>Ample extended time will be available to all students and
  the <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20027/academics/4045/ads_test_related_guidance">ADS
