<p><b>Primary Text</b>

<p><b>Course Description</b>
</font>

<p>In this course we will examine the principles and concepts that
underly computer operating systems.  We will begin by considering what
an operating system is and what it is required to achieve.  We will
then examine how an operating system achieve these objectives. Along the way
specific examples will be drawn from Unix, Linux, Windows, DOS and the
Mac-OS as appropriate to illustrate the concepts that we
study. Projects will be used to reinforce the concepts from the course
and to provide practical experience with systems level programming
techniques.
  
<P>Topics in this course will include:
<UL>
<LI>Operating Systems Organization and Structure
<LI>Processes and Threads
<LI>Process Management
<LI>Scheduling Mechanisms and Policies
<LI>Concurrent Programming and Thread Synchronization 
<LI>Deadlock
<LI>Memory Management
<LI>Virtual Memory
<LI>File Systems
<LI>Protection and Security
</UL>

<p><i>How much time should you expect to spend on this course?</i> I
expect you will spend an average of 9 hours per week outside of class
completing the readings, homeworks and project assignments.  This is
commensurate with the guidelines given in the <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/bulletin/policies.html">Dickinson
College catalog</a>.  If you find that you are spending significantly
more than 9 hours per week on this course, please advise me and we
will work to resolve the problem.

<b>Grade Determination</b>
</font>

<p>The breakdown of grade assignment is as follows:
<br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<TR><TD><img src="images/hw.gif"></td><td>Homework </td><td>10%</td></tr>
<TR><TD><img src="images/project.gif"></td><td>Programming Projects (3) </TD><td>30%</td></tr>
<TR><TD><img src="images/presentation.gif"></TD><td>Research Paper Presentation </td><td>10%</td></TR>
<TR><TD><img src="images/exam.gif"></td><td>Midterm Exam #1 </td><td>15%</td></tr>
<TR><TD><img src="images/exam.gif"></td><td>Midterm Exam #2 </td><td>15%</td></tr>
<TR><TD><img src="images/exam.gif"></td><td>Cumulative Final</td><td>20%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All assignments will be graded on an absolute scale.  As an example
a student scoring an average of 82% on homework, 78% on the projects,
90% on the paper & presentation, 68% on the midterm exams and a 87% on
the final would have a final grade of 79%:

<UL><xmp>
  82*0.10    =  8.2
  78*0.30    = 23.4
  90*0.10    =  9.0
  68*0.30    = 20.4
+ 87*0.20    = 17.4
--------------------
               78.4%
</xmp></UL>

<p>If at the end of the semester the grades fall below the expected
90% (A), 80% (B), 70% (C) scale, a curve may be applied to the total
absolute grades for the course to determine each individual's final
grade.

<br><br>
<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<b>Reading and Homework Assignments</b>
</font>

<p>Reading and homework assignments will be given each time that we
begin a new topic. You should complete the reading assignment before
the subsequent class meeting. Homework will be due at the conclusion
of the topic.  All homework assignments will be collected. However,
not every homework question will necessarily be graded. Homework
should be typewritten when possible and all answers should be written
in clear, accurate English.  Spelling, grammar and phrasing are
important.

<br><br>
<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<b>Math/CS Chats</b>
</font>

<p>Each member of the class is required to attend two <a
href="http://dickinson.edu/~braught/chats/mathchats.html">Math/CS
chats</a> during the course of the semester. Following each of the
chats that you attend, you must send me an e-mail containing a brief
summary (&lt 1 page) explaining, in your own words, what the chat was
about. Your attendance at the chats and the summary e-mails will be
incorporated into the homework grade for the semester. (15pts each =
30 homework points.)

<br><br>
<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<b>Projects</b>
</font>

<p>This course will contain 3 programming projects. These projects
will be designed to reinforce particular material from the course and
will run parallel to the course. The projects will be completed in
groups of 2 or 3 (preferably 2) students.  More information about each
project will be given on the date that it is assigned.

<br><br>
<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<b>Paper & Presentation</b>
</font>

<p>This course requires a research presentation based on a paper from
the most recent Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (<A
HREF="http://www.sosp2007.org/program.html">SOSP 2007</A> -- SOSP is
often described as the world's most prestigious operating systems
conference). Early in the semester, you will in groups of 2 or 3
(preferably 2) select a paper from SOSP 2007. Each group must choose a
different paper, and selections will be on a first-come-first-served
basis, so notify me as soon as you have selected a paper. Throughout
the semester you will conduct background research sufficient to
understand most or all of your selected paper. During the final two
weeks of the semester each group will give a 30 minute presentation on
the paper's contents and the necessary background material.

<br><br>
<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<b>Exams</b>
</font>

<p>All mid-term exams will be timed (75 min.) and given in class.
These exams will be closed book. However you will be permitted one
8.5" x 11" sheet of paper containing <b>hand written</b> notes <i>that
can be read with the naked eye</i>. The final exam will be given at
the time scheduled by the College. The final will also be closed book,
but you will be permitted three 8.5" x 11" sheets of paper containing
<b>hand written</b> notes <i>that can be read with the naked eye</i>.

<b>Cheating and Plagiarism</b>
</font>

<p>This class follows the definition of cheating and plagiarism as
described in the <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/students/codeprt.html">Dickinson
College Student Code of Conduct and Disciplinary System</a>. In
addition to that definition I would like to make several clear
statements about what is permissible collaboration in this class and
what is not.

<UL> <LI>You may discuss the homework assignments and your ideas for
solving the problems.  However, after your discussions you must write
your own solutions.  Whatever you hand in must be your work and only
your work! To be safe I suggest that you do not write anything down
while discussing assignments or ideas with others.  Then following
your discussion sit down by yourself and write up your own solution.
If you are unable to reconstruct the idea for yourself then you do not
fully understand it!

<LI>On group projects you are expected to fully collaborate with the
members of your own group.  You may discuss the assignment and your
general ideas with other groups.  However, under no circumstances may
you show members of other groups your work or discuss its details.
This includes but is not limited to diagrams, text, descriptions, code
or even scratch paper.

<LI>You may incorporate any code that appears in the text or on the
class web site into your solutions.  When you do so you must indicate
the code that was copied and where it was copied from (page number or
URL).  Under no circumstances may you use code written by a current or
previous student, code from another text, another instructor, a
friend, a relative or downloaded from the Internet.  </UL>

<P>In summary, do your own work and do it honestly.  If there is
ever any question about whether what you are doing is permitted then
most likely it is not.  Please ask for clarification on any issues
related to this policy before it becomes an issue.

<br><br>

<font size=+1 color='#006400'>
<b>Late Work Policy</b>
</font>

<p><b>Late work</b>

Each student is permitted a total of three no-penalty days of lateness
over the entire semester; every subsequent day of lateness incurs a
25% penalty for the late assignment. Days of lateness are computed by
rounding up to the nearest whole number of 24-hour periods, so an
assignment submitted one minute after the due time is regarded as
being one day late, and an assignment submitted 27 hours after the due
time is regarded as being two days late.  

<br><br>

<p> Acknowledgment: this syllabus is closely based on that developed
by Professor Grant Braught for the Spring 2006 Operating Systems
course, and I'm grateful for his permission to use it.
