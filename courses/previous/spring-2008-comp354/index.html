<b>Guidelines for final presentation</b>
</font>

<P>
Presentations should be 15 minutes in length, with an
additional 5 minutes for questions and discussion at
the end.  You may present your project using any
combination of whiteboard and slides.  A maximum of
12 slides are permitted.  Text slides may have no
more than 70 words; slides containing any kind of
graph or figure may have no more than 20 words. The
objective of the presentation is to explain the main
idea behind the paper you researched, including a
summary of any necessary background material.  For
full credit, you should also offer some critical
insight into the paper's research, perhaps suggesting
something the authors could or should have done
differently.  As with any other piece of work, you
must acknowledge any content that you copy or adapt:
this applies especially to any slides you copy from
the authors' presentations on the SOSP website.  If
you are working in a team, you may divide the
presentation task in any way you want.

<p>Presentations will be graded on both content (70%)
and presentation style (30%).  Please submit an
electronic copy of any slides to me by e-mail before
delivering your presentation.

Systems course, and I'm grateful for his permission to use it.
