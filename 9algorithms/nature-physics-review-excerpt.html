<h2>Excerpt from <i>Behind the screen</i></h2>

(A review by Andreas Trabesinger of <i>9 Algorithms That Changed the
Future</i>, appearing in Nature Physics, Vol 8(2), February 2012,
p105.)
<P>
Like Faraday's lectures, the book is directed at a general audience,
and MacCormick gently takes the reader's hand and walks patiently
through examples.  Sometimes this is, admittedly, at a rather slow
pace, but at the same time the book is highly didactical, and does
a good job of exploiting a fair bit of intuition along the way. For
me, it's been an ideal bedside-table book. There are some lightbulb
moments and useful (and re-usable) analogies, and, thanks to the
inclusion of anecdotes, it offers a glimpse of the more human side of
computer science...

<P>
MacCormick's book is an easy-to-read and enjoyable guide to some key
algorithms. Above all, it conveys a sense of wonder&mdash;at the
beautiful science, rather than the technical feats, that makes
computers do their magic.
