<h2>Excerpt from <i>Stunningly Successful Solutions</i></h2>

(A review by Paul Curzon of <i>9 Algorithms That Changed the
Future</i>, appearing in Science (335) p1305, 16 March 2012.)

John MacCormick's <i>Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future</i> offers a
great way to find out what computer science is really about. In this
very readable book, MacCormick (a computer scientist at Dickinson
College) shows how a collection of sets of intangible instructions
invented since the 1940s has led to monumental changes in all our
lives...

<P>These stunningly effective algorithms allow computers to achieve
their seeming miracles: results that extend far beyond the abilities
of any human even though the instructions themselves are the work of
humans. MacCormick provides a taste of why we computer scientists get
so excited about algorithmsâ€”for their utility, of course, but also for
their beauty and elegance. On reading <i>Nine Algorithms That Changed
the Future</i>, you too may become infected with the computer science
bug.
