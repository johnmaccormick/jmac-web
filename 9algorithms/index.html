What is this book about?  It explains how your cell phone, laptop,
tablet, and other computers do the amazing things they do. How they
can search the entire web in a fraction of a second. How they can
transmit vast amounts of data over unreliable wireless connections,
without making a single error.  How they can recognize your speech and
handwriting.  And many others.

<P>The book assumes no knowledge of computer science.  It's designed
to be read and enjoyed by anyone who's curious about how our computing
devices manage to be so smart.  Interested?
Please, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=5o_K4rri1CsC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false">peek

<P>Some people were kind enough to say nice things about the book;
here are two of them:
<ul class="imagewrap">
  <li>Chuck Thacker, winner of the 2010 Turing Award&mdash;the
  highest award in computer science&mdash;said: &quot;This book is
  for those who have wondered, 'What actually goes on in my computer?'
  MacCormick clearly explains some of the algorithms used by hundreds
  of millions of people daily. Not the simple algorithms like
  arithmetic and sorting, but more complex things such as how to
  determine the importance of web pages, if and when we are justified
  in trusting a computer-mediated conversation with another person,
  and the puzzling issue of what cannot be computed. I recommend it
  highly.&quot;
  <li>Andrew Fitzgibbon, who created the Emmy-award-winning camera
  software <i>boujou</i>, said: &quot;It's been a long time since any
  book has given me the excitement I remember from reading Hawking and
  Feynman in my teens. This book does exactly that. It reminds me why
  I love computer science. MacCormick's explanations are easy to
  understand yet they tell the real story of how these algorithms
  actually work. This is a book that deserves not just to be admired,
  but celebrated.&quot;
</ul>

<h3>Award from the Association of American Publishers</h3>

Sciences</b>, awarded by the Association of American Publishers.

  <h3>Translations</h3>

<P><i>9 Algorithms</i> has been translated (or in some cases, is
currently being translated) into the following eight languages:
traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian,
Italian, Greek, and Turkish.
