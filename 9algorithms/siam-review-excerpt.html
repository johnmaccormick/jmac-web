<h2>Excerpt from <i>Popular (Computer) Science</i></h2>

(A review by Ernest Davis of <i>9 Algorithms That Changed the
Future</i>, appearing in SIAM News, March 2012 edition.)
<P>

<P>
Despite the widespread popular interest in computers, there are very
few good, popular introductions to the central ideas of computer
science.  <i>9 Algorithms That Changed the Future</i> is certainly one
of the best that I have seen...

<P>The great challenge in a book of this type is to give explanations
that, without oversimplification, are understandable to a general
audience. MacCormick succeeds brilliantly at this. He lays out clearly
the problems to be solved and the ways in which they arise in programs
used by the reader every day; then, patiently, with a wealth of
beautifully chosen examples and analogies, he builds up the key
ingenious ideas behind each of the algorithms, and makes it clear how
they work...

<P>[Gives some interesting criticisms, including a nice suggestion for
a different way of explaining PageRank]

<P>But these are very small blemishes in what is, overall, an
extraordinary achievement in the daunting task of presenting computer
science for a popular audience.
