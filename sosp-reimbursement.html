<h1>instructions for reimbursing expenses for SOSP2013</h1>

Note (posted 11/7/13): these instructions are for reimbursements to organizing committee members. Reimbursements for student travel scholarships will use a separate system. Detailed instructions for how to claim reimbursement for student travel scholarships are not available yet, but will be issued as soon as possible. 

<ol>
  <li>Fill out the <a href="ACMExpenseTemplate.xls">ACM expense
template</a>. Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Ignore the fact that the title of the form says "volunteer
      travel."  This is the correct form for other types of expenses
      too.
      <li>In the "charge to cost center" cell, put "SIGOPS--SOSP2013." 
      <li>In the "committee position" cell, describe your role within
      the conference, whether or not you are actually on the
      organizing committee.
      <li>If this isn't a travel claim, put "none" in the "destination" cell.
    </ul>
<li>Send an electronic copy of the expense template together with
electronic copies of original receipts for all expenses to both of the
following people:
<ul>
  <li>the conference treasurer, John MacCormick
(<a href="mailto:jmac@dickinson.edu">jmac@dickinson.edu</a>)
   <li>the ACM Program Coordinator for Conference Operations, April Mosqus (<a href="mailto:mosqus@hq.acm.org">mosqus@hq.acm.org</a>) 
    </ul>

<li>[Optional alternative] If you prefer to send hard copies of the
expense template and receipts by physical mail, you may do this
instead of sending electronic copies by e-mail. In this case, send a
hard copy of the expense template together with original receipts for
all expenses by physical mail to both
<blockquote>
John MacCormick <br>
Department of Computer Science <br>
Dickinson College <br>
P.O. Box 1773 <br>
 Carlisle, PA 17013  <br>
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
April Mosqus<br>
Program Coordinator: Conference Operations <br>
Association for Computing Machinery<br>
2 Penn Plaza, Suite 701<br>
New York, NY 10121<br>
</blockquote>

<li>ACM will send you a check by physical mail.
</ol>
