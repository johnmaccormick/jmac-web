# Recommendation letters
 
I am almost always pleased to write recommendation letters for
students, but as a matter of courtesy it is best to ask me if I am
willing to write one for you.  It is preferable to do this by making
an appointment to discuss the letter in person, but if that's not
possible, you can also make the request by email.  Once I have agreed
to write the letter, please assist me by sending me an email with the
following information:

1. Even if we have already discussed it, please clearly remind me: (a)
   What is the purpose of the letter? (b) Where and how should the
   letter be sent? (c) By what date must the letter be received?
2. Please list any achievements, abilities, or aspects of your
   personality that you believe it would be beneficial to emphasize in
   the letter. Be brief: use 1-5 bullet points.
3. What is the class you have taken with me that you enjoyed the most,
   and what was the most enjoyable aspect of the class?
4. Choose a piece of good work you did in a class taught by me -- a
   piece of work that makes you proud. Briefly describe the work, and
   explain why you are proud of it. (One sentence is probably
   sufficient to answer this question.)
5. (Optional) Briefly describe a challenge you encountered in a class
   taught by me, and how you overcame it.
6. (Optional) Briefly describe how you applied something you learned
   in a class taught by me to help you with something outside the
   class.
7. Please attach a resume to your email answering the above questions.

Please note that I will not directly copy your answers these
questions.  These answers are intended to guide my thinking about you,
and will help me to construct a convincing letter with relevant
details, but I will only include in the letter statements that I can
verify as true through my personal interactions with you.
