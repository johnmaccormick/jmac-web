<h1>John MacCormick's research</h1>


<p>
My main area of research is computer vision&mdash;that is, getting
computers to understand images and video&mdash;but I enjoy working on
a wide variety of problems in computer science.  For example, I've
also worked on large-scale distributed data storage systems, and pair
programming techniques for undergraduate computer science education.
Here are a few of the questions my research has attempted to address
over the years:
<ul>
  <li>How can we track a person's finger accurately enough with a
  video camera to allow fluent human-computer interaction without
  using any type of touchscreen, mouse, or pointing device?  (This is
  work from my PhD thesis, later published as chapter 7 of the book
  <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=572366">Stochastic
  Algorithms for Visual Tracking</a>, and in the conference
  paper <a href="../publications/eccv2000-handtracking.pdf">Partitioned
  sampling, articulated objects, and interface-quality hand
  tracking</a>.)
  <li>When undergraduate students work in pairs on programming
  assignments in an introductory computer science course, how should
  pairs be assigned? Randomly? Or is it better to pair strong students
  with other strong students and less able students with other less
  able students? Or do pairs of mixed ability lead to better outcomes?
  (This question is tackled in a SIGCSE conference
  paper, <a href="../publications/ability-pairs-sigcse2010.pdf">The
  Benefits of Pairing by Ability</a>.)
  <li>Suppose you are trying to store, in a data center, millions of
  files on behalf of thousands of customers.  To guard against data
  loss, each file should have, say, three copies stored on different
  computers in the data center. How do you decide where to store the
  copies of each file, in such a way that the file can be efficiently
  retrieved later, while keeping the load on each computer balanced?
  (A possible solution is provided by an article in the ACM
  Transactions on
  Storage, <a href="../publications/kinesis-tos-2008.pdf">Kinesis: A
  New Approach to Replica Placement in Distributed Storage
  Systems</a>.)
  <li>These days it's not uncommon to use video chat software such as
  Skype with two cameras, such as the front and back cameras on a
  tablet or cell phone. But can we enhance the experience using more
  cameras?  If so, is this technically possible on commodity hardware?
  Is the conversation further enhanced by giving the remote viewer the
  ability to control the viewpoint?  These questions are addressed by
  the <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/multicam/">MultiCam</a>
  research project and MultiCam software.  The results appear in
  a <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/publications/multicam-extended-abstract-cscw2013.pdf">conference
  paper</a> and
  a <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/publications/multicam-techreport.pdf">technical
  report</a>.
</ul>
