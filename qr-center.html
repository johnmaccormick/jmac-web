    <H3>Quantitative Reasoning Center</H3>

    Dickinson College provides additional support for students taking courses with quantitative content across the curriculum through the <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20525/quantitative_reasoning_center/2962/quantitative_reasoning_center">Quantitative Reasoning (QR) Center</a>. This semester, the QR Center will offer in-person tutoring for our course in addition to general quantitative support. We strongly recommend making an appointment. <!-- The QR Center is also offering remote tutoring to any student who may need it this semester. -->


    
<P><a href="https://dickinson.mywconline.com/">Click here</a> to make an appointment on WCONLINE. Then, access the drop-down menu under "limit to" at the top of the scheduler and select the name of our course. This will restrict the tutor list and schedule to only those tutors approved for this course. When you make your appointment, please also paste or upload your assignment with any work that you have done<!-- and indicate if this will be an in-person or online appointment-->.

<P>The QR Center also provides in-person, drop-in tutoring, but students should check the weekly schedule and list of tutors to ensure a tutor can help with their specific course.
