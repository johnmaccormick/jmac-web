    <H3>Syllabus statement on Accommodating Students with Disabilities</H3>

<!--- statement provided by Disability Services Aug 2022 --->

Dickinson values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded equitable access to participate in all learning experiences. If you have (or think you may have) a learning difference or a disability – including a mental health, medical, or physical impairment – that would hinder your access to learning or demonstrating knowledge in this class, please contact Access and Disability Services (ADS). They will confidentially explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation that Dean and Director Marni Jones will need to determine your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. To learn more about available supports, go to <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/ADS">www.dickinson.edu/ADS</a>, email access@dickinson.edu, call (717)245-1734, or go to the ADS office in Room 005 of Old West, Lower Level (aka "the OWLL").
If you’ve already been granted accommodations at Dickinson, please follow the guidance at <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan">www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan</a> for disclosing the accommodations for which you are eligible and scheduling a meeting with me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your accommodations and finalize your Access Plan. If you will be using any test-taking accommodations in this class, be sure to enter all test dates into your Access Plan in advance of our meeting.    

<h3>Physical access to my office (Tome 242) and classrooms</h3>
 
My office is located on the second floor of Tome, which has an elevator. If there is ever a malfunction with the elevator, I will gladly arrange to meet you at an alternative location or by video conference.

<P>All classrooms in which I teach are accessible by elevator. If there is ever a malfunction with the elevator, I will make all class materials available to you. Given sufficient notice, I will also arrange real-time video conference access to the class.
