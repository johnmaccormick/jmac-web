    <H3>Workaround for permissions issues on the Tome macs</H3>

Some applications do not work correctly when interacting with files
stored on your network storage. For example, usually we double-click
on a .zip file to unzip it, but this is not working at
present. Whenever you encounter this problem, please use the following
workaround:
<ol>
  <li>Copy the file(s) you're using to a folder called "/tmp". To open
  this folder, go to Finder, choose "Go | Go to folder..." from the
  menu, and type "/tmp".
    <ul>
      <li><i>Couldn't copy to /tmp??</i> Maybe someone already put a
      file there with the same name. If this happens, create a new
      folder in /tmp and copy your files into that new folder instead.
    </ul>
   
  <li>Perform whatever action you want to on the file(s). For example,
  if you're trying to unzip a .zip file, double-click on the copy of
  the file that is now stored in /tmp.
  <li>Copy the resulting file(s) back to your network storage, and
  delete the versions in /tmp.
  <li>Do <b>not</b> work directly on the file(s) stored in /tmp. These
  files are stored only on the local machine, and could be deleted at
  any time, either by other users or by a reboot of the machine. In
  addition, other users can read the files in /tmp, so your privacy
  could be violated if you leave files there.
    </ol>
