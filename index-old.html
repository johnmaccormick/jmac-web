<P> John MacCormick has degrees in mathematics from the
University of Cambridge and the University of Auckland,
and a doctorate in computer vision from the University
of Oxford.  He was a research fellow at Linacre College,
Oxford from 1999-2000, a research scientist at HP Labs
from 2000-2003, and a computer scientist with Microsoft
Research from 2003-2007.  Professor MacCormick joined
the faculty of the <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/departments/mathcs/">Department
of Mathematics and Computer Science</a> at <a
href="http://www.dickinson.edu/">Dickinson College</a>
in Fall 2007.  His current research focuses on computer
vision, but he also maintains an interest in large-scale
distributed computer systems. Currently active research
topics include message-passing algorithms for early
vision tasks such as stereo vision, and superpixel
algorithms for image over-segmentation.  <P>
